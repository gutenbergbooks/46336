<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>This paper is an endeavor to make a beginning
of payment on a scholarly debt long in arrears.
Between 1900 and 1910, I spent considerable time
with the Mohave Indians, both in the vicinity of
Needles and with visitors from there to the University.
Summaries of the data recorded, and some
samples of concrete detail, have been published
in one place or another, most coherently in two
chapters of the Handbook of California Indians
in 1925. But I kept deferring presentation of
the fuller data, in particular of the mythological
narratives, many of which run to unusual
length. The tales offered herewith comprise in
bulk about half of the Mohave narrative material
in my notebooks. This is exclusive of the "Great
Tale" of pseudo-historical moving about and
fighting of clan-like groups, my unfinished recording
of which runs to about the length of the
seven tales presented herewith.<a name="FNanchor_0_1" id="FNanchor_0_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_0_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_0_1" id="Footnote_0_1"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_0_1">[1]</a></span>
The fragmentary beginning of one of these
clan or war legends is given in Handbook, pp.
772-775.</p>
</div>

<p>In quality the narratives of the Mohave resemble
not only those of the other Yuman tribes
of the Colorado River, but also, to a considerable
extent, those of the Shoshonean Indians of
southern California. The typical story of the
region is not a relatively rapid narrative of
plot, but a detailed elaboration still further
expanded by the inclusion of a song series. A
myth might be characterized as a web loaded
with a heavy embroidery of songs which carry an
emotional stimulus of their own, and at the same
time endow the plot with a peculiar decorative
quality and charge it with a feeling tone which
renders of secondary importance the sort of consistency
of character, motivation, and action
which we expect in a narrative. This is a paraphrase
of how I expressed myself in regard to
Gabrielino mythology in 1925. It holds probably
even more forcibly for the Mohave. Many of their
tales seem to appeal to them more in the manner
of an ornamental pattern than as a portrayal of
a related sequence of events. Essentially all
Mohave myths are told in an almost ritualized
style. They are not, strictly, rituals; but their
telling and singing largely take the place of
formal rituals in the culture. The songs which
belong to the great majority of narratives can
be sung with equal suitability for a dance at a
festival or victory celebration; for the mere
pleasure of singing; as an expansion of the spoken
tale; or as a "gift" of lamentation for a
dying or dead relative.</p>

<p>The Mohave validate what happens in their lives
by referring it to their dreams. Success in life,
the fortunes of a person or of a career, are believed
to be the result of what one has dreamed.
A Mohave dreams among other things&mdash;or perhaps
above other things&mdash;of the beginnings of the world
in the far distant past.</p>

<p>He dreams of being present at the creation and
witnessing its events. Thereby he participates in
them and gets certain knowledges: powers for war,
for curing, for success in love or gambling. Such
mystically dreamed powers are what really count in
human life, the Mohave firmly believed. Over most
of native North America the acquisition of power
by dreams or visions of spirits is the basis of
shamanism; and where religion is simple, it is
largely constituted of shamanism. The Yuman tribes,
however, have evolved the special belief that the
visions are not of the spirits of now, but of the
spirits and great gods of the beginning of the
world. This group of tribes in their philosophy
transcend time and project their souls back to the
origin of things. This act they call dreaming. The
basic and most significant dreams are not those of
last night or of one's adolescence, but those which
one had before birth&mdash;while still in the mother's
belly, they say. It is these prenatal dreams which
the newly born baby and the child may forget, but
which come back to the growing boy and to the man
when he hears others singing or telling similar
experiences. As they see it, the tribal mythology
is thus first learned by personal participation in
it as an unborn soul. Secondarily, it is strengthened,
clarified, and perhaps adjusted by what one
learns from others. Some old Mohave of my acquaintance
admitted that they "also heard" or learned
their special lore, usually from blood kinsmen, in
addition to dreaming it; but all denied having been
"taught." The distinction may seem verbal to us,
but I am sure that it is not verbal to them.</p>

<p>Now and then a person will admit having learned
a story from others, apparently without any sense
of inferiority therefor. Mostly, however, the old
men claimed to have dreamed what they knew. This
was without any very evident sense of pride about
it&mdash;in fact, dreaming was so common that it would
be only what one had dreamed, not the fact of
dreaming, that could give distinction. I am sure
that my informants believed they had dreamed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
the way they said. A people starting out with
preconceptions such as these would not be likely
to be able to explain matters in terms of what
we consider psychological reality. I suspect
that many men, as they grow older and perhaps
begin to sing song series with their kinsmen,
begin also to brood about them in periods of inactivity.
Their minds presumably run on the implications
of the words of the songs, until,
under the spell of the tribal theory, they come
to believe that they have in their own person
seen the events of the far past happen.</p>

<p>At any rate, informants now and then mention
in the midst of their mystical narrative, randomly
and in the most matter-of-fact way, "Then I saw
him doing so and so," or "I was there," or "Then
he said to me."</p>

<p>Those narratives which the Mohave evidently
consider historical, and they are the longest
of all, the Great Tales, come unaccompanied by
singing. The story of the actual first beginnings
of the world seems also to be without songs; and
so is the prolix account of the origins of culture,
of which I give a version herewith under
the title of Mastamho, the culture hero. Matters
of "history" are in the Mohave mind related to
matters of war, and are therefore clean and honorable.
Cosmic origins, however, seem to be felt
as allied to shamanism and doctoring. Now the
doctor can cure, but he can also kill; and there
is consequently some reluctance to sing, or
even to hear, series of doctoring songs, no doubt
because of their associations with illness. The
songs of a good many non-shamanistic narratives
are danced to when there is a festival or gathering.
Each story has its appropriate dance step,
as it has its characteristically recognizable
songs, and its prescribed rattle, struck basket,
palm slap, resonating pot, or other accompanying
beat. There are even one or two kinds of singings,
notably Pleiades, for which I could never learn
that there was a narrative and the two songs of
which are simply sung over and over again for the
dancers. The non-shamanistic song series are
"given away" or "destroyed" (t&#353;upilyk) at the death
of a relative. If he dies gradually, they are sung
during his last one or two days and nights. If he
dies suddenly, they are sung from then until his
cremation. This is considered equivalent to the
destruction of property for the dead. But, as the
Mohave say, after a time a man forgets his grief
and begins to sing his songs again.</p>

<p>The songs accompanying any narrative seem to
run from about a hundred to about four hundred.
All the songs of any one series are variations on
a basic theme, which most Mohave can recognize
and name on hearing. Most of the variations presumably
are improvised according to a pattern
style. It seems impossible that hundreds of minute
variations should be kept separately fixed in memory.
An informant's listing of the localities or
stages of his story at which he sings is usually
fairly consistent from one listing to another.
But the number of songs that he says he sings at
each stage varies considerably more. Obviously, if
his recollection is uncertain whether he sings
three or four songs at a particular point, he is
unlikely to carry precise minor variations of his
melody fixed in his memory.</p>

<p>For convenient reference, I have followed the
plan of putting into a single paragraph each section
of a story which a narrator told as a unit
until he said that here he sang so many songs about
the episode. Informants fell of themselves into the
habit of thus punctuating the narrative by mentioning
the song numbers. These paragraphs I have then
numbered consecutively for convenience in reference
to episodes; and a list of captions corresponding
to the paragraphs has usually been added to serve
as an outline of the song scheme and guide to the
story.</p>

<p>Most of the tales take a night to tell, or a
night and part of the morning, or up to two nights,
according to the narrators. If anything, they
underestimate the time required, in my experience.
It seems doubtful that they would keep an audience
through periods as long as this; and I have the
impression that many of them had never told their
whole myth continuously through from beginning to
end. They also found it difficult to make clear
what sort of occasions prompted the telling. Theoretically,
when it is not a matter of a dance or
a funeral, a man both narrates and sings, telling
an episode and then singing the songs that refer
to it, until his audience drops off or falls asleep.</p>

<p>It remains to characterize the tales themselves
and their style.</p>

<p>If the narratives are long, they almost inevitably
show minor inconsistencies. The narrator may
say that a thing is done four times, and then proceed
to narrate six variations of it. Contradictions
of plot may occur through lapses of memory
or shifts of the narrator's interest. Sometimes it
is difficult to decide whether this has happened,
or whether the interpreter or recorder misunderstood.
This holds for a number of discrepancies in
the first tale, that of Cane, which are noted in
detail in the discussion and footnotes. Such inconsistencies
proved difficult to clear up with informants:
explanations had a way of introducing new
discrepancies. On the other hand, most narrators
keep pretty successfully to the main thread of
their plot and proceed in its development in a
rather prolix, step-by-step, orderly manner.</p>

<p>Major inconsistencies are due to shifts in participation
or identification of the narrator and
hearer with the characters. He who seems to have
been the hero, turns evil without warning and our
sympathies are enlisted for a new personage. This
is a quality which is also notable in southern
California Shoshonean myth narratives. I suspect
that the Mohave feel less need than we of participating
with their personages, both the story and
its setting being so formalized and stylized.</p>

<p>Where fighting is involved, motivation becomes
particularly elusive. The main thing seems to be
that there should be war and the happenings that
go with war. Hence, in place of a definite sense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
of identification of the teller or hearer with
one or the other of the personages, there is
often a sense of foreboding or of the inevitability
of what will happen. This is not confined
to the tales which professedly deal with war,
but recurs in the Cane myth, and, with reference
to death instead of war, in that of Deer. In the
latter, the identification is particularly obscure.
Jaguar and Mountain Lion create a pair of
Deer in order to kill them for the benefit of
the future Walapai. But a full three-quarters of
the story tells about the Deer, their thoughts
and feelings; so that it is difficult not to
feel them as what we would call the "heroes" of
the plot. If so, they are unquestionably tragic
heroes.</p>

<p>The tales are given their great length less
by fundamental complications of plot than by
expansion of detail. The most common expansion
is geographical. There are long travels. If no
events occur on the journey, many places are
nevertheless enumerated, and the traveler's
feelings or thoughts at each point, or what he
sees growing or living there, are expatiated on.
The Mohave evidently derive a satisfaction from
these mental journeys with their visual recalls
or imaginings.</p>

<p>In Raven the physical movement of the whole
story exists only in the mind. How people will
travel and fight is told and sung of, but in the
tale itself the entire journey is that from the
rear to the front of the house in which the two
fledgling heroes grow.</p>

<p>Another method of expansion is more stylistic.
What is going to happen is discussed first, and
then it is told over again as a happening. There
are arguments between personages on whether to
do this or that; whether to understand an event
in one way or in another; or as to what is going
to happen later.</p>

<p>Most of the tales are given some tie-up with
Ha'avulypo in Eldorado Canyon and the first god
Matavilya and his death there; or with Mastamho
who succeeded him and his Avikwame which we call
Dead or Newberry Mountain&mdash;both north of Mohave
valley. These tie-ups seem to be for placement
reference: they indicate that the events occurred
in the beginning of time. Sometimes an incident
of the creation serves as the introduction of a
tale; or it may be only alluded to. The heroes or
personages are preponderantly boys, sometimes even
miraculously precocious babies. Then overnight
they may have grown up sufficiently to get married.
These irrationalities or surrealisms of time should
not be disconcerting when one remembers that to the
Mohave the whole basis of knowledge of myth is due
to a projection from the present into the era of
first beginnings&mdash;is the result of the utter obliteration
of time on the mythological and spiritual
level. Even the culture hero Mastamho is sometimes
described as merely a boy; so are the future
tribes whom he is instructing; at times the informant
refers to himself as a watching and listening
boy. There is an evident feeling that the eras
dealt with are those when everything in the world
was fresh and young and formative.</p>

<p>I have put the Cane tale first because it has
more plot and less of mere prolixity, geographical
or otherwise, than the others. Next follow three
stories that to the Mohave are concerned with war:
Vinimulye-p&#257;t&#353;e, Nyohaiva, and Raven. After that
comes the story of Deer, with animal actors; and
then some fragments on Coyote, without songs and
perhaps unorthodox, secured from a woman. Women are
not precluded from dreaming, but on the whole the
Mohave seem to have no great interest in women's
dreams. The last is another tale unaccompanied by
songs, the long one of Mastamho, which is essentially
an account of the origin of human and tribal
culture.</p>

<h2><a name="chap01" id="chap01"></a>I. CANE</h2>


<h3><a name="chap01s1" id="chap01s1"></a>THE NARRATOR</h3>

<p>The story of Cane, Ahta, more properly Ahta-'amalya'e,
Long Cane, was told me on three days
between April 24 and 27, 1904, with one day of
intermission, by a middle-aged man named T&#353;iy&ecirc;re-k-avas&#363;k,
or "Bluebird," who said he had dreamed
the tale, beginning at Avikwame. I neglected to
write down personal or biographical details about
him, and dare not trust my memory at this interval.</p>

<p>This story has more plot interest than the
majority of those which the Mohave profess to
dream and sing to. It might be described as a
tale of adventures on an almost epic scale, and
it does not systematically account for the origin
or institution of anything, although a bit of
cosmogony drifts in toward the end.</p>

<p>The version recorded was told carefully and
accurately. There are a number of internal discrepancies,
especially as regards relationship
of the characters and topography, which are considered
in a section following the story itself;
but the plot is well constructed and maintained.</p>

<p>The song scheme is also given after the tale.
The songs are accompanied with a double beat of
a stick struck against the bottom of a Chemehuevi
bowl-shaped basket. Cane is not danced to.</p>

<p>The Cane type of plot recurs in another kind
of Mohave singing called Satukh&ocirc;ta, of which
only a brief outline was obtained. The singer of
Satukh&ocirc;ta beats time by striking his palm against
his chest.</p>


<h3><a name="chap01s2" id="chap01s2"></a>THE CANE NARRATIVE</h3>


<h4>A. Kamaiav&ecirc;ta Killed at Avikwame</h4>

<p><a name="ch01para1a" id="ch01para1a"></a>1a. All the people at Avikwame had gone out of
the house and had sent for (the great snake in the
ocean to the south) Kamaiav&ecirc;ta.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> They thought it
was he who had killed Matavilya and they wanted to
kill him. No one knew this to be so but all believed
it. Then when he came they killed him, and
his body lay stretched over the earth. When he was
dead, I<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> took a piece from his tail, the rattle
nearest the body. I took it for good luck. Several
tribes dream about this killing: the Yuma, the
Maricopa, the Kamia, the Walapai, the Halchidhoma,
and others down to the mouth of the river.<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

The Kamaiav&ecirc;te incident seems to be mentioned
only for the purpose of fixing the time and place
of the beginning of the story. The myth properly
begins at this point. Most Mohave song-myths begin
with an allusion to the death of Matavilya,
of which the Kamaiav&ecirc;te story is an after-incident.</p>

<h4>B. Two Brothers Go Off</h4>

<p><a name="ch01para1b" id="ch01para1b"></a>1b. Now there were two brothers there. They
stood east of the house and told of it. They did
not speak, but sang. They sang of its posts, the
rafters, the sand heaped around and over it, and
the other parts. (4 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para2" id="ch01para2"></a>2. Their names were Pukehane, the older, and
T&#353;it&#353;uvare, the younger.<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> They went north a short
distance, where there was a little gravelly place
and thorny cactus. The ground-squirrel, hum'ire,
lived there. When the two brothers came, it ran
away, crying like a boy. It had never seen them
before. They stood there and sang about it. (3
songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_4" id="Footnote_1_4"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_1_4">[4]</a></span>
Both names refer to cane. Hip&#363;ke is the "end
of the root" or butt. Hip&#363;ke-hane is probably the
full form. T&#353;it&#353;u-v&#257;re is said to refer to the
points of the cane. In the text, &#363; and &#257; have been
rendered u and a in these two names.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para3" id="ch01para3"></a>3. Then they went north again a very little
distance.<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> There they saw a rat, hamalyk. They did
not kill it, but looked at it and sang about it.
(2 songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_5" id="Footnote_1_5"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_1_5">[5]</a></span>
"About 50 yards," not far enough to necessitate
a new name for the place.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para4" id="ch01para4"></a>4. Now it was sundown. They struck their fire-flints,<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
made a fire, and sat by it. They did not
eat anything all night. In the morning they were
hungry. One thought that they should kill the rat
and eat it. His brother said: "That is good." So
they killed the rat and ate it. They stayed there
that day, thinking. The next day, in the morning,
Pukehane, the older brother, said: "We have no
place to live." T&#353;it&#353;uvare said: "Yes, that is true.
Where can we get wood to build a house?" Now Pukehane
was intelligent; he was born thus. Therefore
he made sticks out of his saliva.<a name="FNanchor_1_7" id="FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Thus in one day
they built a round house. At night they went into
it. (3 songs.)</p>

</div>

<p><a name="ch01para5" id="ch01para5"></a>5. Now it was three days.<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In the morning they
hunted rats. When they killed a rat, they hung it
by its head under their belts. Pukehane said: "I
do not think this is good." Then he took<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> two net-sacks,<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and they put the rats into them and carried
them on their backs. At sunset they came back
to the house. Now two men lived at Avikwame, Hatpa-'aqwao&#952;t&#353;e,<a name="FNanchor_1_11" id="FNanchor_1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>

with my younger brother's sons (ivitk). I will
not live with this man (Nume-peta) who is not my
relative." And he came and lived with them. So
they were three. In the morning, the two boys
went hunting rats again. As the rats were shot,
they squeaked. The boys stood and listened and
laughed. (1 song.)</p>

tribes after a time will do like this: let me
see how far you can shoot." They bet their arrows.
The elder shot far. The younger did not shoot far
and lost, lost all his arrows. The quiver was
empty and he tied it around his waist. He said,
"I will bet the rats that I killed." Then he lost
all his rats. They came home and he had no arrows
and no rats, only his bow. Their father's older
brother saw them. He said, "Why do you not do
right? This is wrong. Do not do it any more. That
is not what I came here for. I came in order that
when you go hunting you bring them here and I eat."
(1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para7a" id="ch01para7a"></a>7a. Hatpa-'aqwao&#952;t&#353;e said, "We are three men

If three men live in a house everything is ready
for them when they come home to it. But there is
no woman here and that is why there is no wood
and water. If you get a woman she will cook."
The boys said, "Yes, we will do that." That night
Pukehane stretched his hand to the southeast toward
the Maricopa and got corn in it. He got much
and laid it in the corner of the house. Then he
stretched his hand out northeast, toward the
Kohoaldja Paiute, and took wheat.<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Now they had

<h4>C. The Brothers Get Wives</h4>

<p><a name="ch01para7b" id="ch01para7b"></a>7b. In the morning the two boys went west.
There was a man who had a daughter T&#353;ese'ilye;<a name="FNanchor_1_14" id="FNanchor_1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
her they wanted to get. As they went west they
saw a bird hanging in a tree in a cage of red and
white woven cloth.<a name="FNanchor_1_13a" id="FNanchor_1_13a"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13a" class="fnanchor">[13a]</a> The bird was hwet&#353;e-hwet&#353;e.<a name="FNanchor_1_15" id="FNanchor_1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>

<p><a name="ch01para8" id="ch01para8"></a>8. When they reached the house, Pukehane did
not take the bird with his hand, but caused the
cage (<i>sic</i>&mdash;the bird?) to be outside the door. The
bird was singing: the woman was inside; she came
out, saw it in front of the door, and said: "What
sort of people are you who have come? That bird
belongs to me; do you not know that? It watches
everything I have when I go out to gather seeds."
The two boys stood and laughed, the older east of
the door, the younger west of it.<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The woman went
back into the house, put on a (pretty) dress, and
beads around her neck. She took a white peeled
willow stick, qara'asap, to sweep the dress under
her thighs so as not to crumple it when she sat
down.<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Tied to the top of her dress she had two
bags of paint (k&ocirc;mkuv&#299;), one black, one red. When
she came to the two boys standing outside the door
she did not go to the older, she went to the
younger: she liked T&#353;it&#353;uvare. Pukehane said, "She
is mine." His younger brother said, "No, if she
were yours she would come to you." The older said,
"She is mine." The woman said nothing. The older
embraced her. The younger said, "Do not embrace
her. She belongs to me." He embraced her too and
they both held her and pulled. Pukehane became
tired. He stood aside. "You are the better; take
her," he said. So now they had one woman: T&#353;it&#353;uvare
had her. (1 song.)</p>

</div>

<p><a name="ch01para9" id="ch01para9"></a>9. They started to go home from there: Pukehane
wanted to. They had far to go, too far for one day.
So they slept in the desert where no one lived.
T&#353;it&#353;uvare made a bed. Pukehane said, "My brother,
when you marry, both of us sleep with the woman.<a name="FNanchor_1_18" id="FNanchor_1_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
That is what you said." T&#353;it&#353;uvare had not said
that: Pukehane only wished it; and T&#353;it&#353;uvare did
not let him. Then in the morning Pukehane said,
"Let us go, my sister-in-law."<a name="FNanchor_1_19" id="FNanchor_1_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> (1 song.)</p>

"You at the vagina, I at the anus." While the
younger slept with her, the older sat up, had an

sit on it, could not.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="ch01para10" id="ch01para10"></a>10. They started. At noon, when they came to the
house, the woman was ashamed, because it was the
first time she was married. Hatpa-'aqwao&#952;t&#353;e said,
"I want to see my younger brother's daughter-in-law."
She did not look up: she had long hair&mdash;down
to her hips&mdash;behind which she hid her face.
The old man took her by the hand, led her inside,
and took her around the house. He wanted her to
grind corn. Now the three men felt glad, when they
saw her grinding corn. They looked to see how she
worked; all of them smiled. "See how beautiful she
looks," they said. She was clean and wore beads
around her neck and on her ears and wrists, and a
dress of willow bark, and was painted. (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para11a" id="ch01para11a"></a>11a. In the morning she was going to make mush
of the corn she had ground. The two brothers were
still in the house. The old man was outside: he
wanted to help her cook. He poured the corn into
the pot and she stirred it and put in salt.<a name="FNanchor_1_20" id="FNanchor_1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
When there was enough, she boiled it, gave some
to the old man, put some in a dish for the two
boys, and took it inside to them. Then the three
ate together; the old man sat outside. When the
sun set they built a fire in the house near the
door. When it was dark the house was warm and
they stayed there. The two brothers did not say
anything. Their father's older brother spoke
again. He said, "This is one woman. If you get
another, it will be well. Go east and take Sun's
daughter." That is what the old man said.</p>

An informal domestic scene, such as could
still be seen forty years ago. The cooking is in
front of the house: the ground corn is boiled;
the old man stands by and assists; eating is in
or outdoors, men and women together or apart.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para11b" id="ch01para11b"></a>11b. In the morning the two boys went east.
When the sun was halfway up they heard a cock<a name="FNanchor_1_21" id="FNanchor_1_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
making a loud noise, telling the time. (2 songs.)</p>

Kwaluyauve. Cf. the flint, wheat, cloth, etc.
The cage, however, is native: all the river tribes
kept bird pets in stick cages. In <a href="#ch01para86">86</a>, however,
the woman's bird is a masohwat.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para12a" id="ch01para12a"></a>12a. Very soon, after four or five steps,
they saw a cage hanging, Sun's daughter's cage,
with red and blue cloth tied to it for ornament:
it was hanging high. The two boys came to it,
took the cock out of his cage, and put him by
the door. He crowed and the woman heard him.
She said, "What sort of men are you? Do you not
know anything? That cock belongs to me. He takes
care of me and stays with me always. You have
spoiled him." She went back into the house, put
on her dress and her beads, and came out. T&#353;it&#353;uvare
embraced her. His older brother said,
"She belongs to me." "No, she is not yours. She
is mine," said the younger. "No, she is mine,"
said the older. The older was unable to hold
her. "Well, she is yours," he said. Now the
younger had two wives.</p>

<p><a name="ch01para12b" id="ch01para12b"></a>12b. They started to go. The woman looked back
and saw her house. She said, "I thought my house
was (already) far away, but it is only a little
distance." She stopped and urinated. "Wait and
stand, while I tell of my home." She meant that
now she was going with them and would live with
them and would not go to her house any more.
(2 songs, about her house.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para13" id="ch01para13"></a>13. They went on again. Now all the stars
had been made,<a name="FNanchor_1_22" id="FNanchor_1_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> but the two boys were wise, had
dreamed, and knew all. They said, "We will tell
about the stars; of mountain sheep (Orion), and
of Hat&#353;a (the Pleiades)." (2 songs, about the
constellations.)</p>

Night comes on as they travel, apparently; but

</div>

<p><a name="ch01para14" id="ch01para14"></a>14. In the afternoon they came home. The (new)
woman sat down outside at the southeast corner
of the house. She was ashamed, and did not go
indoors with them. She had long hair, down to
her thighs; she did not say anything. The old
man was ready for her to grind: he had a metate
prepared inside. Now he came out, took her hand,
and led her indoors. Then she ground corn. As
she ground, blood flowed on her thigh. They said,
"Look at her, she is menstruating: the blood
makes a streak on her thigh."<a name="FNanchor_1_23" id="FNanchor_1_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> (1 song.)</p>

</div>

<p><a name="ch01para15" id="ch01para15"></a>15. Now there were two women to work, and it
did not take them long to grind enough for mush.
One of them built a fire and put a pot on it;
the old man came out to help them. When the water
boiled, the old man poured the corn into it and
one of the women stirred. She put in salt and
tasted it; there was not enough, and she put in
more until it was good. Now she gave the old man
some. She put some in a large dish and took it
in to the two boys. They ate together, the two
women and the two boys. At night they all lay
down indoors. The old man thought, "It is not
right: one of them has two wives. They are two
brothers but one has no wife." He said, "You are
two brothers, but the older has no wife. He must
have a wife too. In the morning go north and get
one for yourself also. Kukho-metinya's<a name="FNanchor_1_24" id="FNanchor_1_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> daughter
is the one that I want you to find." In the morning
the two boys went north. Then Kukho(-metinya)<a name="FNanchor_1_24a" id="FNanchor_1_24a"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_24a" class="fnanchor">[24a]</a>
met them, flying in the air. They said, "The bird
is intelligent: he flies to meet us." (2 songs.)</p>

</div>

<p><a name="ch01para16" id="ch01para16"></a>16. When they came there, there was a bird in
a cage. It was a kukho.<a name="FNanchor_1_24b" id="FNanchor_1_24b"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_24b" class="fnanchor">[24b]</a> They took it out with
their hands and set it by the door. The woman was
inside, heard it, came out, and saw the bird. She
said, "Where are you two from? You are foolish. Do
you know that that is my bird in the cage? Why do
you take it out?" They stood and laughed. She went
inside again, put on her dress and her beads, and
came out. She went to the older one and he embraced
her. The younger wanted to come to her also, and
said, "She is mine." But Pukehane said, "No, she is
not yours, she is mine." Then T&#353;it&#353;uvare said, "Well,
she is yours." He let him have her, because he had
two already. Then they started home. (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para17a" id="ch01para17a"></a>17a. When they came to the house the old man
took her by the hand, led her inside, and wanted
her to grind corn. Now there were three women
grinding and it did not take long. The old man
helped them cook. They gave him some, and the
three women and the two brothers ate together. The
sun set, it became dark, they built a fire in the
house. The two brothers did not speak: the old man
was thinking again. He said, "Now you two brothers
each have a wife." Pukehane had his bed in the
southeast corner of the house; T&#353;it&#353;uvare, at the
southwest; the old man lay in the center of the
house. He said, "T&#353;it&#353;uvare, you have two wives;
Pukehane, you have only one. I think it will be
best for you to get another. If you each have two
it will be well. If one of you has two and the
other only one, it will not be right. I want you
to go south to get one. Get Tankusahwire's<a name="FNanchor_1_25" id="FNanchor_1_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>

<a name="ch01para17b" id="ch01para17b"></a>17b. In the morning they went south. They saw
a hotokoro bird in a cage. The cage was woven of
red and blue string. They had not come there yet:
as they were going they saw it. (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para18a" id="ch01para18a"></a>18a. When they arrived, they took the bird in
their hand, set it at the door, it walked about
there. The woman heard it and came out. She said,
"That bird is mine. It takes care of me. It lives
with me always. You know why you have done that!"
It was as if she were angry. She was not angry
but she said that. She went back into the house
to put on her dress. She put it on, and beads on
her neck and ears and wrists. T&#353;it&#353;uvare, the
younger, saw her come out but did not go to her.
He let his older brother embrace her. He said
nothing. He thought, "It is well." Then they went
back north. They came home the same day. The
three women were grinding corn. The new one did
not go inside: she was ashamed and sat outside.
The old man took her in. He gave her a metate
and the four of them ground. When they had finished
they made mush: the old man helped them:
he wanted to taste if there was enough salt.
He said, "If there is not enough, put in more.
If it is right, set it off the fire." Then they
gave him some. They put more in a large dish and
took it inside. All the women and the two young
men ate together. At sunset they built a fire
inside. Two women went to the east side of the
house, two to the west. The two men were lying
in the corners shading their eyes with their
hands (&#948;ok&#333;uk). The old man lay in the center of
the house. He got up, thought, and said, "There
is another thing good to have: it is cane. When
you play on it the sound goes as far as the sky
and everyone can hear it." He said that in the
night.</p>


<h4>D. Quarrel over Cane: Elder Kills Younger</h4>

<p><a name="ch01para18b" id="ch01para18b"></a>18b. In the morning the two brothers went west,
far west. There were no clouds but there was
lightning and it thundered. T&#353;it&#353;uvare said, "Do
you hear that? I think that is dangerous." Pukehane
said, "Well, I do not care. Perhaps it will
go well, perhaps it will go wrong. We will go
anyway: it does not matter where we die. We do
not know. Do not mind: if we both die in this land
it will be well." (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para19" id="ch01para19"></a>19. They went on west. They climbed up a mesa.<a name="FNanchor_1_26" id="FNanchor_1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
They stood and looked down. Then they saw cane.
T&#353;it&#353;uvare was glad to get it. Pukehane said, "Do
not go yet! Wait! Good ones do not grow everywhere:
they grow in only one place. Wait until we tell
about them. I will tell about the roots (butts?),
the large roots that they have." The younger brother
stood and listened to what the older one said
about the cane roots. (1 song.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

River terrace of gravel.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para20" id="ch01para20"></a>20. They went down to the cane. There was a
cane to the east: Pukehane put his hand on it.
There was a cane at the west: his younger brother
put his hand on that. The younger one said, "I do
not want the top." He cut the top off and gave it
to his older brother: he wanted the bottom part
where it is large. Pukehane said, "A little boy
like you takes a little piece from the top." T&#353;it&#353;uvare
said, "Don't you know when there are two
brothers the younger wants the most of everything?
I want the large one, you take the top." Pukehane
said, "Very well. It is good." T&#353;it&#353;uvare said,
"If you had not given me the bottom but had left
me the top, I should have cried, because the
younger always wants most and if he does not get
it he cries. You thought I would cry. Well, my
brother, I feel happy." T&#353;it&#353;uvare wanted to break
the cane with his hands. Pukehane said, "Wait!
You are able to break it with your hands, but do
not do so. We have both dreamed well. We have no
knife here but I can get a knife to cut it with."
(1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para21" id="ch01para21"></a>21. He did not make a knife. He put his hand
out to the west and had a knife in it. The younger
asked, "How many joints shall we cut?" "Three,"
said Pukehane. (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para22" id="ch01para22"></a>22. Then Pukehane cut the cane at the butt. He
was holding the top end, his younger brother the
bottom end, but Pukehane wanted that. T&#353;it&#353;uvare
said, "No, you said you would let me have it!"
"No," the elder said. They did not break it: both
of them held on. T&#353;it&#353;uvare did not want the top;
Pukehane wanted to take it all: but his younger
brother held fast, and he could not take it away
from him. Pukehane was larger and knocked his
little brother down, but T&#353;it&#353;uvare held on: he
did not let go, he held tight. Then Pukehane put
his foot on his brother's belly: still he held on:
He nearly died, but he kept his hold. When Pukehane
saw that his younger brother was nearly killed, he
stopped. He took hold of him and made him stand up.
"Well, my younger brother, I will let you have it,"
he said. The older was a doctor: he had dreamed.
He thought, "Well, I will let him have it, and
after a while I will kill him." T&#353;it&#353;uvare said,
"How must we use them, long or short?" Pukehane
told him, "The Yuma make them long, of four or five
joints, with a hole right through them. We do not
do that: we use three joints." (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para23" id="ch01para23"></a>23. Then they went back and came home. They laid
the cane on the ground. They told how they had
brought it. (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para24" id="ch01para24"></a>24. When the two boys sat down, the women had
wheat bread<a name="FNanchor_1_27" id="FNanchor_1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> ready and gave it to them. They began
to eat outside. The old man came out from the house
and saw the two boys about to eat the bread. They
had not swallowed it yet: their mouths were full.
The old man said, "Did I not tell you that that was
dangerous? I said not to eat anything with salt in
it<a name="FNanchor_1_28" id="FNanchor_1_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> until you have washed yourselves." They spat
it out. When it was nearly sunset they built a fire
and all went into the house. That night the younger
one became sick: he had the nightmare and talked to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
himself.<a name="FNanchor_1_29" id="FNanchor_1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Before it became day, Pukehane started
to go outdoors. He could make people go to sleep
with &#952;av&ocirc;&#952;apanye. He held it in his hand and
struck a house post. So they all went to sleep:
his younger brother too. Then Pukehane went outside,
took the cane, and decorated it with his
saliva.<a name="FNanchor_1_30" id="FNanchor_1_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In the morning he said, "Younger
brother, why do you not get up? Do not sleep: a
common man is always doing that. You are likely
to get sick. Get up and help me." The younger
sat up. Pukehane had already finished painting
his cane. T&#353;it&#353;uvare came out and wanted to
paint his. He did paint it: but when he held it
out to look at, there was no paint on it: it
looked dark (unpainted) to him. He said, "I
thought I had painted it well. I think I shall
die." He threw the cane away to the north, went
indoors, and lay down. Then Pukehane sent for
people to come for his brother who was about to
die; he sent for Nume-peta at Avikwame. When a
man will die they send word of it about and begin
to sing. (1 song.)</p>

(magpie), a&#952;ikwa (woodpecker), at&#353;y&ocirc;ra,
&#952;iny&ecirc;re (sparrowhawk). Pukehane took one of them,
peeled the skin off its head, and let it go. One
he skinned on the back, one on the belly, one
over the ribs, and one under the eyes. He threw
the pieces of skin away, and let the birds loose.

sick. Therefore he did not stay by him but by
Nume-peta. T&#353;it&#353;uvare said, "Move me a little
so that I can tell of all my bones before I die."
(1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para28" id="ch01para28"></a>28. The two men got wood. When they brought it,
Pukehane and Nume-peta were thinking what they
wanted to be in the future: they wanted to teach
the Chemehuevi, Yavapai, Walapai how to do. The
sick man was not dead yet. Then they took his
rib out to use for a skin-dressing tool. They
took his kneecap for a shinny ball. They took
his shinbone, cut off each end, and used it to
juggle up and catch on the back of the hand.<a name="FNanchor_1_32" id="FNanchor_1_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
They took these bones out of his body and so
killed him. Then they went to Avikwame, Pukehane
taking his own two wives with him.<a name="FNanchor_1_33" id="FNanchor_1_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> T&#353;it&#353;uvare's
wives and Hatpa-'aqwao&#952;t&#353;e stayed, stood, cried,
and sang. When it was dark the old man took a
knife and cut the two women's long hair, and his
own. One of the women was pregnant. (1 song.)</p>

<h4>E. Birth of the Hero</h4>

<p><a name="ch01para29" id="ch01para29"></a>29. They cried all night. In the morning&mdash;they
had not thrown their food away, and had corn and
beans&mdash;they ate. Then Sun's daughter went back to
her home; the other woman (T&#353;ese'ilye) and the old
man were still in the house. In the afternoon the
woman said, "I am going to have a child. I have a
pain on each side of my belly." Then the old man
said, "Yes, that is the way." At night the child
had not been born yet, but it sang. They heard it
talking and singing inside. They said, "He is
singing. We hear it." (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para30" id="ch01para30"></a>30. The old man said, "That sort of a boy will
be somebody; he will be a shaman. When he is a man,
he will make me be like a young man again. I am
glad." Then the boy said from inside, "Too many
people are passing by the house. I am going to make
rain so that no one will come by while I am being
born: I want no one to know or hear or see it. I
do not want people to know when I emerge." (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para31" id="ch01para31"></a>31. The woman could not sit still from her pain.
She crawled around into the corner of the house,
and outdoors. Then the boy said, "Sit still. I want
to emerge." He did not know where to come out, at
the mouth or anus or ribs. He said, "Sit still.
Keep your legs still, so that I can come out; do
not move them!" The woman said, "Old man, do you
hear what the boy in me says?" The old man said,
"That sort of a boy is wise. He will be a shaman."
When it became day the boy came out. They made
hot sand to lay him on and covered him with hot
sand up to his neck. (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para32" id="ch01para32"></a>32. The night the boy was born it rained. (Far
in the north) Nume-peta thought, "I believe that
child has been born and has made the rain. If one
of you goes there today, you will see the child."
A man went: he saw the child sitting in the door.
Hatpa-'aqwao&#952;t&#353;e asked him, "What do you want?"
The man said, "Nume-peta sent me to see this child."
Hatpa-'aqwao&#952;t&#353;e said, "Yes, it was born this morning."
So the man went back and told Nume-peta.
Nume-peta said, "Did I not know it? The child is
wise and will be a doctor. It made rain so that
no one would know it was being born; but I knew it,
for I am a doctor too." Then Nume-peta took his
people and Pukehane, and they all came to see the
child. They said, "We will look at it. If it is
a boy, we will kill him, because he will be a doctor
and will kill us; when he is grown he will make
us sick. But if it is a girl, we will not kill her.
It will be well: she will work and get water. A
girl will do that, but a boy will not do that: he
will kill us." Now they all stood at the door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
looking at the child. Hatpa-'aqwao&#952;t&#353;e hid the
child's penis, drawing it back to the anus. Then
they all said, "No, it is not a boy, it is a
girl. If it were a boy we would kill it, but it
is a girl." So they all went back. (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para33" id="ch01para33"></a>33. Then the woman suckled the child and sang.
They had made them think that the child was a
girl. It was a boy but they would not let them
know it. (1 song.)</p>


<h4>F. Shinny Game with Father's Foes</h4>

<p><a name="ch01para34" id="ch01para34"></a>34. The child grew fast. In four, five, six
days it smiled and laughed. In a year it was as
high as that (gesture), and walked around and
played. Now Nume-peta and Pukehane came again
with all their people. They played shinny with
the dead man's kneecap. Then the child, dressed
as a girl, went out to watch, not knowing those
bones. Some of them gave him a bone to make a
doll of, for he wore a dress and looked like a
girl. Every day he went to play where these
people played, and at sunset came back to his
house. So it was three nights: the next night it
would be four. Then his mother told him, "That
doll, the bone you play with, is from your father.
Your father traveled to be married. And he
traveled to get cane, he and his older brother.
The younger was wise: he was superior to the
older; but the older was a great doctor. He made
his younger brother sicken and die. That bone is
from your father, and so is the bone they play
shinny with." (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para35" id="ch01para35"></a>35. Then the apparent little girl said, "I
did not know that. If I had known that it was
the bone of my kin I should not have played with
it." So he said and cried. He cried all night
and never suckled. In the morning when the sun
was up he went under the shade; he was tired from
crying, lay down and slept a little. Then he
dreamed. The insect &#952;ono&#952;akwe'atai<a name="FNanchor_1_34" id="FNanchor_1_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> sat on his
lip while he slept and said, "All of them play
with those bones. They think it is amusing but
it is a bad thing. They are not the bones of an
animal. If they were animal bones it would be
well, but they are your father's bones." When
the boy dreamed that he sat up. He went back
into the house. That night he wanted to send his
mother home: he did not want her to live there
any longer.<a name="FNanchor_1_35" id="FNanchor_1_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> He told her, "Go west.<a name="FNanchor_1_36" id="FNanchor_1_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> These
people here are my relatives but they do not
treat me right. They said they would kill me. I
will stay here. The old man, my (father's) uncle,
will stay here too. He is wise: he saved me or I
should have been dead long ago. I want him to stay:
he can beg around the houses and get something to
eat and water to drink. He can live in that way and
be well; but I want you to go west." The woman took
a little round dish<a name="FNanchor_1_37" id="FNanchor_1_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and put glowing coals into
it. So she lit her way, to know where to go.<a name="FNanchor_1_38" id="FNanchor_1_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Then
she went off westward, traveling by that light. When
she was gone the boy thought about her. He thought,
"Why have I sent my mother away like a bird? A
bird's nest is on the desert; it sleeps on the desert,
where no one lives." Then he was sorry for her
and cried. (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para36" id="ch01para36"></a>36. That night when there were only the two of
them there, the boy told the old man, "I am going
to leave you. You stay here. Listen to what I will
do." He thought he would do something to the people
that played with his father's bones, but he did not
yet know what. Then the old man Hatpa-'aqwao&#952;t&#353;e said,
"It is well. You will die somewhere and I will cry
for you here. That will be all. I can live. I am
not very old yet. I can go about begging for food.
I will come to people's houses and they will give
me something to eat, for they will know me and that
I am poor and hungry. I shall live like that staying
on here." Then in the morning they all came
there to play ball again. They had short shinny
sticks, nearly straight, not long and curved.<a name="FNanchor_1_39" id="FNanchor_1_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
When the boy saw them, he went outdoors, took earth
and rubbed it on himself, so that no one would see
him, or know him; for he wanted to take away their
ball. So he turned himself into a halye'anek&#299;t&#353;e
lizard.<a name="FNanchor_1_40" id="FNanchor_1_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Now they played. They came near him: he
was lying by the side of the playing field: no one
knew it. Now they played toward the south and back
again, four times, and one side won. Then the boy
seized the ball: no one saw him take it: no one
knew he had it. He went back to his house. Now he
wanted to throw it, but did not throw it yet: he
wanted to know in which direction to throw it.<a name="FNanchor_1_41" id="FNanchor_1_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
First he wanted to throw it north, but did not.
Then he was going to throw it south, then west,
then east. He kept it in his hand and stood there.

(amaiy&ecirc;it&#353;e) four times, still holding the ball, he
struck the ball with a stick and it flew west like
a meteor (kway&#363;). It fell in the mountains and
broke them and killed the people who lived on them:
it killed them all. The boy stood and heard. He
thought, "No one is there now: they are all killed!"
Nume-peta and Pukehane said, "That boy! I knew he
would do it: he has killed all those people. He
will kill us too. You shall see: he will do that."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
The boy did not hear them, but he knew (what they
said). He was glad and laughed and shouted and
ran. He ran north to Avi-kwutap&#257;rva: There he
stood. (2 songs.)</p>


<h4>G. Journey South to Sea</h4>

<p><a name="ch01para38" id="ch01para38"></a>38. When he stood there at the river he thought
how to cross it. He said, "I thought I was a man
who knew everything, who had dreamed well." Then
he piled up sand, four heaps, so high. He began,
at the nearer end, to level them with his foot.
Then the river was full of sand all the way
across, enough to walk on. So he crossed and
stood on the other side, the east side of the
river. He thought which way to go, whether east
or south. Then he thought, "Well, I will follow
this trail south." (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para39" id="ch01para39"></a>39. He went downriver to I&#948;&ocirc;-kuva'ire,<a name="FNanchor_1_42" id="FNanchor_1_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> did
not stop there, but went on to Aht&#353;ye-'iks&#257;mta
and Qara'&ecirc;rve. There it was sunset and he slept
in the thick willows and cottonwoods by the river
bank: it was a good place to sleep, with much
brush. Many birds were in the trees: early in the
morning they all awoke and made much noise. Then
he could not sleep well: he tried to but could
not. So he sat up and listened to the birds calling.
Tinyama-hwarehware<a name="FNanchor_1_43" id="FNanchor_1_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> was sitting on a tree
singing loudly. When a boy sleeps somewhere alone
he is lonesome and afraid; so this boy was afraid
and could not sleep. Then he said to the birds
and the insects, "You make too much noise. I cannot
sleep. Be quiet!" So they were quiet and he
slept again. (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para41" id="ch01para41"></a>41. He went on south to an overflow lagoon,
Hanyo-kumas&#952;eve.<a name="FNanchor_1_45" id="FNanchor_1_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> From there he went south a
little distance to where the aht&#353;ye grass was
high. There a rattlesnake stuck up its head and
shook its rattle noisily. When he saw the snake
he was frightened: he had never seen one before.
He nearly died from fear: he stood unable to
move. (2 songs.)</p>

without shaking its tail, making no sound, and
not biting. He kicked it and threw it with his
feet, four or five times. Then he picked it up,
and used it for a belt, and put it around his
neck and into his mouth. So he played with it,
and the rattlesnake died and he threw it away.
He said, "I am not afraid of you. If you were dangerous
to me you would bite and kill me, but you are
not dangerous and so it is you will not bite me."<a name="FNanchor_1_46" id="FNanchor_1_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
He left the snake lying there, and went south,
to Amai-nye-qotarse, did not stop there, and
went on south to Kamahn&#363;lye. Two men were hunting
there. When they killed a deer they did not cook
it but ate it raw: He saw their red mouths and
was afraid of them. He saw that they were wildcats
(nume). (5 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para43" id="ch01para43"></a>43. The two wildcats went off east and he went
on south. He came to Aha-kuminye. A horsefly
(hoane) lived there at the edge of the mesa in a
cavity. It came to him, lit on his back and
shoulders, and flew off again. Then the boy
thought, "It is intelligent like a man. It knows
something. When it sees me it comes to meet me."

<p><a name="ch01para44" id="ch01para44"></a>44. The horsefly flew away and did not come
back. Then the boy said, "That is not a man. If
it were a man he would come back to talk to me. I
will go on." Then he went on south to Hot&#363;rveve.
There were astake trees there on the mesa: there
he saw that a hummingbird (nyenyene) had its nest.
(1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para45" id="ch01para45"></a>45. He went on south to Sampulya-kwuvare. There
he told the name of that place. (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para46" id="ch01para46"></a>46. He went on south to At&#353;q&#257;qa. There he followed
the (Sacramento) wash up eastward, away from
the river. The day was bright and there were no
clouds. Then he told about clouds, for he wanted
the air fresh and the day cooler because it was
too hot to walk. He did not stop but kept on going
talking of that. (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para47" id="ch01para47"></a>47. As he went on, soon there were clouds all
over the sky. He came to Hanyikoit&#353;-kwamve,
crossed the wash, and went southward toward the
mountain Akokehum&#299;. Then he came to Avi-ahnalya
(Gourd Mountain). (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para48" id="ch01para48"></a>48. He went on south but not very far. He had
not yet come to Avi-a'&#299;sa ("screw-mesquite mountain"),
but stood and told of his going there.
(1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para49" id="ch01para49"></a>49. He went on south and reached Akokehum&#299;.
There he saw a spring: a single screw mesquite
grew there. He said, "I think this is my food: I
will eat it. There is water here too; so I shall
be alive. I was lucky to find this spring and this
tree." He stood by the tree and sang. (5 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para50" id="ch01para50"></a>50. Then he pulled the mesquite-screws off the
tree and ate them. When he had eaten, he drank,
and went on. He went south to Ahwa&#7789;a-kwim&#257;t&#353;e.<a name="FNanchor_1_47" id="FNanchor_1_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>

He came to Ama&#7789;a-kuhulto&#7789;ve. There there grew wild
grapes (ahto&#7789;a) on the ground: they were ripe and
he picked them and held them in his hand and
played with them. He did not eat them. (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para52" id="ch01para52"></a>52. He threw them away and went on south. He
came to Hakut&#353;yepa, Bill Williams Fork: he followed
that creek up east. Then he met a badger (mahwa).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
It smiled when it met him. He did not try to
catch it and the badger ran off. He paid no attention,
but followed the creek up east. He went on

and mountains and caves there, and he told about
them. (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para53" id="ch01para53"></a>53. He stayed there awhile and played. Then he
followed a trail south and came to Avi-su'ukwilye,
a sandhill. There he stood on a mesa. Oh&#363;t&#353;ye,
coyote-grass, grew there. He saw a jack rabbit
eating that. He thought, "Its body does not look
like a man's, but it feels when it gets hungry,
and it eats. I thought it knew nothing, but it
does know something: it knows that that is good

keeping on it, going south. Far away he saw high
mountains: they looked as if they were near, but
they were far. They were called Avi-melyehw&ecirc;ke:
he was going there: he arrived when it was nearly
sunset. (3 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para55" id="ch01para55"></a>55. There he slept. It was (Western) Yavapai
country. In the morning he did not want to go
farther south. He turned northward and came to
Avi-hupo. (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para56" id="ch01para56"></a>56. From there he went on north to near the
river, to Selye'aya-'ita.<a name="FNanchor_1_48" id="FNanchor_1_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> There he stood, wanting
to cross the river to the western side, to Kuvukw&#299;lye.

farther one, well south of Mohave territory.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para57" id="ch01para57"></a>57. Then he did as he had done before. He made
four piles of sand and leveled them into one ridge
with his feet and made the river dry enough so
that he could walk across, and came to the west
side of the river. Now he was at Kuvukw&#299;lye. He
said, "I can stand here and tell the names of
the mountains." (3 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para58" id="ch01para58"></a>58. He turned south again and came to Aha-kumi&#952;e
where is a spring. He thought no one had seen it
before. "I found this. No one knew of it." People
had seen the spring, but he thought not. (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para59" id="ch01para59"></a>59. He went south to Ama&#7789;a-hiya, "earth-mouth."
There there was a hole or crack in the ground, red
like blood. He saw it and thought, "How did this
come to be?" He walked around it looking in, and
stooped over it. (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para60" id="ch01para60"></a>60. He went and came to T&ocirc;ske. There he stood

He is near Yuma land now.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para61" id="ch01para61"></a>61. Going south again he came to a low mesa,
to a place called Yelak-&#299;mi, "goosefoot." (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para62" id="ch01para62"></a>62. Going on he came near the Yuma country.
He stood on the mesa, looked down on the ground
for planting, and saw much cane. He thought, "How
did the cane come to be here? I did not think it
grew here. I will go down to see it." (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para63" id="ch01para63"></a>63. He went down to where the cane grew, broke
off a piece as long as a flute, and played with
it. He came (abreast of) Enpe&#952;o'auve, the Cocopa
Mountains, south of Yuma. He kept along the edge
of the river, going fast, running, walking, and
keeping on. (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para64" id="ch01para64"></a>64. He went on until he came to the sea (the
Gulf of California). The waves were high. When
they came up on the land and went back, there were
holes and some of the water did not run back, but
stayed in the holes and made ponds. A crane (ny&#257;qwe)
was there. He said, "That is an eagle (asp&#257;): it
surely looks just like an eagle." (3 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para65" id="ch01para65"></a>65. The bird flew off eastward. He said, "That
bird is afraid of me: it flew away." He walked
along the sea to the east. As the waves came and
went they left shells there: hanye, aht&#353;&#299;lye, aha-nye-amokye,
tam&#257;&#952;e, ah&#257;spane, and two other kinds
used by doctors.<a name="FNanchor_1_50" id="FNanchor_1_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> He knew that these shells were
good to wear. No one had told him, but he knew.
He took them in his hand and played with them.

Hanye are small clamshells cut into shape of a

</div>

<p><a name="ch01para66" id="ch01para66"></a>66. Then he threw the shells away and kept going
east. He looked back to the west and saw ducks,
heard them making a noise. He thought, "What are
those? They have feathers. They are like persons,
but they are ducks." There was a large flock of
them on the sea, close together. (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para67" id="ch01para67"></a>67. He went on east. Where a little lagoon
came out of the sea, there was a hat&ocirc;mpa'auve.<a name="FNanchor_1_51" id="FNanchor_1_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
He lived in that lagoon. The boy saw him fishing
and was afraid. He thought, "I will tell about
him. Then I will go on." (2 songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_51" id="Footnote_1_51"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_1_51">[51]</a></span>

"a large horse with feet like a duck's and a tail."</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para68" id="ch01para68"></a>68. He went on, not following the edge of the
sea any more, but north and northeast. Soon the
sea was far away. He came to a gravelly place, a
good level place. There he saw a'i-kume&#948;&#299; trees
(mountain or desert trees with curved thorns&mdash;catsclaw
acacia?) He told of them. (1 song.)</p>


<h4>H. Marriage and Contests with Meteor and Sun</h4>

<p><a name="ch01para69" id="ch01para69"></a>69. He went on east or northeast. Soon, in a
level place in the desert, he saw women's tracks,
four women's. The tracks had been there a year but
they looked as if they had been made the same day.
He said, "I think I know these four women. I know
who they are. I think they are Sun's wives."<a name="FNanchor_1_52" id="FNanchor_1_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>

</div>

<p><a name="ch01para70" id="ch01para70"></a>70. Going on to the east, he found a house. No
one was there. He said, "Sometimes people go away
and their house is empty." He went in and stayed.
He had in mind the four women. He said, "I think
the oldest of those four sisters knows me." He
did not say this aloud: he thought it. He did not
want anyone to know that he had come: he did not
want anyone to see him. "But the oldest one will
know me, I think," he said. He slept there. He pulled
out one of the sticks from the east side of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
house and made a little fire of it and slept. In
the morning he made a wind to blow away the
ashes so no one would see he had been there, and
smoothed the sand inside the house to cover his
tracks. He thought, "I will turn to cane. I
want the wind to blow me away into the bushes.
The oldest sister will find me." Then he went
out and lay there in the brush, a piece of cane.
He left his shadow inside the house. (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para71" id="ch01para71"></a>71. The four women came near. The boy was
singing loudly. They could hear him from far.
He was telling the names of the four women. The
oldest was called Taseky&ecirc;lkye, the next Ahta-t&#353;a&ocirc;re,
the next Ahta-kwasase, and the youngest
Ahta-nye-masape. Then the youngest said, "My
oldest sister, do you hear him say that? He calls
you first. He names you too, and you; and me:
He calls all four of us. Do you know that?" The
oldest sister said, "Yes, I know it. There were
two men in the north. They were married. I think
this is their boy. He knows us. No one knows us,
but this is their son. When we enter the house
you will see no one there, and no tracks. He
will have turned to a stick or perhaps to a
piece of charcoal. Perhaps when you (are about
to) break a coal it will say, 'You are hurting
me: look out!' If it says that do not break it.
Perhaps when you break a stick it will speak
and say, 'Look out: you hurt me!' Then do not
break it. Perhaps he will be lying in a crack
of a house post. Perhaps he will turn into a
piece of cane and lie outdoors in the brush."
So Taseky&ecirc;lkye, the oldest sister, said to Ahta-nye-masape,
her youngest sister. Then they went
into the house. She said, "There is no one here.
There are no tracks. He slept here last night
but there is no one. Put your foot on the fire
place: There is warmth there." They drew the
sand away with a stick and there they found fire.
"See, I knew there was fire here," said Taseky&ecirc;lkye.
(2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para72" id="ch01para72"></a>72. The four women stood in the house. Taseky&ecirc;lkye,
the oldest, said, "Look around. When
you find a crack in the house post, push something
into it. If it says, 'Ana (ouch, look out),
you are hurting me,' then stop. Or pick up a
lump of earth and start to break it: If it says,
'Look out, you hurt me,' then do not break it."
They took up a coal and broke it. It did not
speak and they knew it was not he. Taseky&ecirc;lkye
said again, "When you find him, do not say, 'He
is rotten, he stinks.' And look in the brush;
perhaps you will find him there." So Ahta-nye-masape,
the youngest, went west, and the others
all about, to look for him in the brush. Then
the youngest found him: he was long dead, stinking,
rotten, full of maggots. With a stick they
scraped off the maggots. But there was no flesh
on him: he was all bones: he had been dead too
long and was dry: they could not bring him to
life. The four of them stood there. (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para73" id="ch01para73"></a>73. Taseky&ecirc;lkye said, "Bring a karri'i basket;
I want to put him in." But her three sisters
said, "What for? I do not like that. I
don't want my basket spoiled." Then Taseky&ecirc;lkye
brought her own basket. She said, "Come, help me.
Take him up with your hands and put him in the
basket." But her three sisters turned away. They
stood and would not look at him: they vomited:
none of them helped her. Then she herself gathered
the flesh and bones and put them into the basket.
She said, "Help me put it on my head: I want to
carry him to the house." Her three sisters did not
want to help her: he was too old and maggotty and
stinking: they would not come near, but stood
around. "Do it yourself," they said; "take the
basket up with your own hands and set it on your
head." So she took it up and carried it to the
house. The others followed her. Then Taseky&ecirc;lkye
said, "Make a fire." She wanted hot sand. When it
was hot, she poured water on it and leveled it.
Then she piled the maggots and flesh and bones
there together and covered them with the basket.
Then she went and bathed. Her three sisters looked
at the thing. They did not know what she would do
with the rotten boy. She came back, took off the
basket, and a boy was sitting there, as big as
that boy (pointing to a ten-year old). The three
women looked at him. Taseky&ecirc;lkye sat by him combing
her hair with her fingers; the boy had no hair
yet.<a name="FNanchor_1_53" id="FNanchor_1_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para74" id="ch01para74"></a>74. The man whose house this was had four wives.
He was Kway&#363;, meteor, shooting-star: he hunted
people and ate them. The four women were Sun's
daughters<a name="FNanchor_1_54" id="FNanchor_1_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and Kway&#363;'s wives. Then Taseky&ecirc;lkye
said, "That boy does not eat. He does not become
hungry. I know what he likes: he likes tobacco.
That is all he uses for food. Ahta-nye-masape,
bring a dish<a name="FNanchor_1_55" id="FNanchor_1_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> with tobacco in it." The youngest
sister went and got the tobacco and gave it to the
boy. He took the dish and poured the tobacco in
his mouth: he did not take it up with his hands.
"Do you see? I know what he likes," said the oldest
sister. The boy had not enough. He looked
around and picked up the tobacco stalks lying about
the house and ate them. The three sisters laughed.
Taseky&ecirc;lkye said, "I think he wants more: he has
not had enough." Then the youngest sister gave him
a cane as long as a hand, filled with tobacco.
The boy smoked it. He did not smoke it long: he
sucked once and swallowed the smoke: he did not
blow it out. The whole cane was burned up except
the end. He chewed that up and spat it out. The
women laughed. They liked to see that: they had
never seen a man doing it.<a name="FNanchor_1_56" id="FNanchor_1_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para75" id="ch01para75"></a>75. Taseky&ecirc;lkye said, "When our husband comes
back he is tired from gambling with hoop-and-poles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
and is hungry. Then he is angry. We had better
go gather something to eat: we have nothing in
the house." Every morning Kway&#363; went early to
gamble, carrying his poles: one day he would win
and one day lose. Now the women all took their
baskets (karri'i). Taseky&ecirc;lkye said, "We are
going to gather kwinyo or what we can find. We
are going off, but will come back. The man who
lives in this house, Kway&#363;, hunts persons. The
people who live near he does not kill: he kills
those who live far away.<a name="FNanchor_1_57" id="FNanchor_1_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Sometimes he kills
two or three men and carries them home. He cuts
them up but does not cook them: he eats them raw.
If he does not eat them all, he slices the meat
and dries it on a tree. And he does not throw
away their bones: he puts them away. When they
are dry, he says, 'Grind the bones: I want to
eat mush.' We grind and he eats it. He does not
eat what we do. I am afraid that when he comes
he will swallow you and keep you in his stomach
(isoq&#257;te). I am thinking of that and afraid of
it. That is why we will not go off the whole
day but will come back. If you were not here we
should be gone all day." So they went, carrying
their baskets. The boy thought, "How will he
swallow me? I do not think he can swallow me.
I am wise; I have dreamed; I am a shaman, too.
He cannot do that. Sun is my father's elder
brother (nav&#299;k). Now I have come to his house.<a name="FNanchor_1_58" id="FNanchor_1_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
If he sees me he will not let Kway&#363; swallow me."
Then he said to the house, "In the north I saw a
house like this, a good house. A man who lives
in a house like this does not eat people."<a name="FNanchor_1_59" id="FNanchor_1_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>

The kinship is inextricable. His only uncle
was Pukehane, who had killed his father, whose
second wife was Sun's daughter. About the "two"
Suns and their daughters, see above and below,
notes <a href="#Footnote_1_35">35</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_52">52</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_54">54</a>,

was appealed to at this point, he repeated
what he had said first, that the four women were
Sun's wives, but contradicting the statement in
the narrative two paragraphs above, that they
were Sun's daughters and Kway&#363;'s wives. Perhaps
the kinship is specifically conceived at any
given moment in the story, but the concepts waver
and contradict one another as the long narrative
progresses. A kind of decorative pattern is followed
rather than logical or factual consistency
maintained. At the same time the inconsistency
is precisely of the sort that is familiar in
lengthy dreams. This seems significant in view of
the Mohave assertion that they dream their tales.
Even though this cannot be literally true, they
perhaps tend to regress into a dream-mood in
thinking of and relating the stories.</p>

came. The boy saw him coming and went into the
house to hide. He drew his breath into his belly
and made it tight and projecting. He wanted to
go on a rafter. He thought, "If I lie on it he
will not be able to pierce me. If he stabs (at)
me I will jump to another rafter. If he stabs
(at) me there I will go to another." Kway&#363; came:
he had a spear (ota&#7789;a). He said, "Who came into
my house? I smell him but I do not see him. Tell
me, has some one come? I know it." The boy heard
him but did not say a word, lying on top of a
rafter. Kway&#363; struck at him. The boy jumped to
another rafter. Kway&#363; stabbed at him there. He
penetrated the rafter too far: his spear stuck:
he could not pull it out: he became tired. The
boy jumped to another rafter. Again Kway&#363; struck
at him and his spear stuck in the rafter. He
could not pull it out and left it hanging in the
rafter; he went and sat at the door. The boy came
down and sat in the middle of the house between
the posts. "Give me tobacco, I want to smoke,"
he said. Kway&#363; said, "You are too young to smoke,
but I will give you tobacco. You do not know how
to smoke cane, for the Mohave smoke a pipe of
clay." The boy said, "I know how to do that, for
that is my name (I am cane)." Kway&#363; said, "My
younger brother's son, is that you?"<a name="FNanchor_1_60" id="FNanchor_1_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The boy
said, "Yes, I know you: that is why I came here.
If I had not known you I should not have come."
Kway&#363; thought, "I thought that the boy born from
the two brothers in the north was wise. I was
afraid of him. I was thinking he would kill me."
He did not say that but he thought it. He said,
"You do not know the small cane?" The boy said,
"Yes, I know it. It belongs to me. I dreamed good
luck from it." Kway&#363; said, "I have meat here. I
have people's bones ground and made into mush. I
ate of it but I did not eat it all and there is
some left. But I think you do not like that."
The boy said, "I do not know that kind: I do not
like it. I know cane; but wait, do not give it to
me. I will tell you about it first: then give it
to me." Then he told of joints of cane.<a name="FNanchor_1_61" id="FNanchor_1_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> (2

Here the narrator interjected the following:
When Kway&#363; came home, he thought: "No one comes to
my house; I want no one to come. I am stingy. I
want no one to see my wives' faces. I am bad and
want to kill any man who has been among my wives.
My brother (<i>sic</i>) is good, he goes to play with
people and wants to be friendly; but that is not
my way."</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para77" id="ch01para77"></a>77. Kway&#363; said, "Have you told all?" "Yes," he
said. Then Kway&#363; handed him two pieces of cane
filled with tobacco. The boy smoked one. It was
gone, but he still had the other. Kway&#363; said,
"Stay here. I always go hunting. I eat whatever I
find. If I find a little boy on my way I swallow
him; if an old man or an old woman, I eat them
too." Then Kway&#363; went. Then after he had gone,
Sun came. The four women had not yet returned.
Sun said, "You are a young boy, too young to travel.
Where are you from?" The boy said, "I came this
morning." Sun said, "There is a bad man here: he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
eats everybody. But he did not eat you: I think
you must have dreamed well." The boy said, "Yes,
he did not eat me." "Where are you from?" asked
Sun. The boy said, "I came from Avikwame. I was
born there, I lived there." He meant that his
father had died there and his mother had gone
away and his (father's) uncle was still living
there. "I left my uncle<a name="FNanchor_1_63" id="FNanchor_1_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> (Hatpa-'aqwao&#952;t&#353;e) in
the north and came here. He knows everything,
but I do not. He told me, 'Your relatives live
far south.' You are my uncle:<a name="FNanchor_1_64" id="FNanchor_1_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> that is why I
have come here." Sun said, "I knew you when you
were at Avikwame. I know what you wore: you wore
cut raven-feathers." He had not (really) seen it,
the boy did not tell him, nevertheless Sun knew
it. "You wore a woven belt and beads. I know what
else you wore: a white feather rope." The raven
feathers, aqaqa soverevere, he called kwasol&#299;&#952;
so&#952;&ocirc;re. The woven belt, sor&#257;pe, he called sor&#257;pe.<a name="FNanchor_1_65" id="FNanchor_1_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
The beads, nyap&#363;ke,<a name="FNanchor_1_66" id="FNanchor_1_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> he called hapany&ocirc;ra. The
feather rope,<a name="FNanchor_1_67" id="FNanchor_1_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> so&#948;&#299;lyk nyit&#353;&ecirc;ve, he called kwinyekal&#257;k.
He said, "Will you gamble?" The boy
said, "I am poor. I have nothing to bet. My father
died and my mother went away and I have nothing."
Sun said, "You have something at the back of
your head" (in his hair). "No," said the boy.
After a time he said, "Yes, I have it: I have a
bead necklace. But I do not want to play." He
had hidden that, but Sun knew it. (2 songs.)</p>

Sun asked, "Will you bet your body?" The boy said,
"Yes. What will you bet against my body? Put up
your four women."<a name="FNanchor_1_68" id="FNanchor_1_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Then they played (hoop-and-pole).
They played running to the south. The boy
won and counted one. They ran and threw to the
north and the ring fell on his pole and he had
two points. Then they threw to the south and he
won and had three. Then they threw north and he
made that point and had four. So the boy won. He
won Sun's apparel and the four women. Then Sun
said, "I want to bet my house, my dishes, and
the sack I have in the house. I have made heaven
and earth into a sack."<a name="FNanchor_1_69" id="FNanchor_1_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> They bet, played again
as before, four times, and the boy won: now he
had won the house too. Sun said, "I will bet you
the lake (slough) where I bathe. I will bet you
my looking-glass water (haliy&#333;i). And I have a
beaver who lives in the water: that is why you
cannot see him; but he belongs to me and I will
bet him. I have a scorpion (men&#299;se), too, and
bees (&#952;amp&ocirc;): I will bet those." So they played
four times, to the south and the north and the
south and the north, as before, and the boy won
again. When he had won all those things he said,
"I will bet what I have won against your body.
Will you play?" Sun said, "Yes, I will bet it."
The boy said, "If you lose your body, lie down
where we have played. When I take my knife, do
not move: I will cut you to pieces because you
have lost." Sun said, "It is well: if I lose I
will not move. Say what you like: name whatever
part you like to cut first." Then they played
for four points. Now Sun was lying: the four
women belonged to Kway&#363;; and the house belonged
to Kway&#363;, and what was in the house, but Sun
said it was all his own. So they played. Three
times the boy won. Now Sun had nearly lost: once
more and he would lose. Then he did not go on
playing: he stepped back, and stood, and did not
throw his pole, and talked, for he was about to
lose his body. The boy thought, "If Sun loses his
body I think he will do something to me: he will
try to kill me, and I know how. He has sky-heat
(ammay ip&#299;lyta) in his body: I know he has it and
he will try to kill me with that. I have not seen
it but I know he will do that. He will make his
casting pole stand up, climb up it, and drop it
on me and the house to kill me." So the boy thought;
but then, "I will prevent it: I will make ice. When
he throws his fire on the brush of the house the
ice will prevent it." Soon Sun climbed up his pole
and threw the fire on the house. The boy caused
ice to be there and it put out the fire. Sun began
to climb to the sky. The boy climbed after and
tried to strike him but could not reach him. Then
he slid back and stood on the ground. Sun went on
up, jumping like a ghost. The boy said, "You
thought I was a little boy and did not know anything;
but I am wise. I will turn you into something.
I will make you be what you are now (the
sun)." The fire was still running all around the
house. The four women came back and saw the fire.
Taseky&ecirc;lkye said, "Did I not know that that boy
was wise, that he would do something we have never
seen?" The boy stood outdoors and put the things
he had won into the little sky-sack. He thought
(about Sun), "I will make you be something: I will
turn you into something: I will make you be two.
Some days there will be two suns (the sun and a
sun dog)." That is what he did. (1 song.)</p>

looking-glass<a name="FNanchor_1_70" id="FNanchor_1_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and the beaver I have won! I will

boy and cried with much noise. The boy said, "You
do not know me? I am the one that feeds you." And
he went to see his scorpion. He thought, "I would
like to see it." The scorpion was lying still,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
but when the boy came, it moved about, afraid.
"Do you not know me? I am the one who feeds you,"
he said. "Well, I will go to see the bee that I
have won, my bee." The bee did not know him and
wanted to sting him. It flew to him, under his
arm, lit where his neck and shoulder came together.
The boy said, "Do you not know me? Know me now: I
am the one who feeds you." (2 songs.)</p>

there in the playing field (mat&#257;re). He wanted to
see his body. He wanted to look in his mirror.
He thought, "I want to see what sort of a looking
boy I am." When he looked; he said, "I have no

<p><a name="ch01para81" id="ch01para81"></a>81. He had no long hair, only short hair like
a boy: he saw that. He went to the bathing place
and dived in northward. He came out again and
dived westward. Then he dived to the south. Then
he dived to the east.<a name="FNanchor_1_71" id="FNanchor_1_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> He came out and now his
hair fell below his hips. Then he wanted to make
a little wind to dry his hair. He did not sit
down, he did not lie down, he stood. Then the
wind dried his hair. He came back and looked in
his mirror. He said, "I think I will wear eagle-down
(&#952;ume)." He put his hand out to the north
and got eagle-down. Then he put that on and
looked at himself. "That is good," he said. Then
he put out his hand to the east and got a woven
("Navaho") shirt, tolyek&ocirc;-pa, and a woven strip
of wool cloth (tolyek&ocirc;-hare-hare) for a breech-clout.
"Now I have all that," he said. He put his
hand out to the west<a name="FNanchor_1_72" id="FNanchor_1_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and got beads (nyap&#363;ka).
He thought, "When I was a boy I did not know what
was good: I did not wear anything. Now I know
what is good and am wearing what I have never
worn before. I am ready now and it is good." He
was standing where he had bathed. The four women
were crying (at the house); he heard them. Taseky&ecirc;lkye,
the oldest, was thinking about the three
persons (the boy, Kway&#363;, Sun), wondering which of
them had been turned into something and killed,
for none of them had come back yet. "Perhaps the
boy has done that," she thought. Then she said to
her youngest sister, "Get water! You have a jar
you made yourself." "Yes, I have one," she said,
and went to get water. When she saw the boy all
dressed up, she dropped her jar and went and embraced
and kissed him. She was away for some time.
The oldest sister said, "What is the matter with
her that she does not come back? What did she see
when she went to get water?" And she sent another.
When the other woman came and saw Ahta-nye-masape
embracing and kissing the boy, she too threw away
her jar and hugged him. "He is a good-looking boy:
I want to marry him," she said. Then Taseky&ecirc;lkye
sent her other sister. She came and saw the boy:
he was not embracing the two girls; they were
holding him, and saying, "I want him." "No, I
want him." Then she also dropped her jar, for she
wanted him too. Now the three were gone and did
not come back. Then the oldest sister thought,
"Well, there were three of them, but they have not
brought water. I will go myself and drink and then
return here to cry." She took her jar, went there,
and saw the three women surrounding the boy, embracing
him; but the boy was not moving, not saying
a word. When she saw it she ran up: "Did I not know
it? You like that boy: all of you want him: I knew
it!"<a name="FNanchor_1_73" id="FNanchor_1_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> She too wanted him, but could not take him
away from the others. Now they had all come there
to get water and there was no one at the house.
Then the four women said, "We will take you to the
house. We do not want you to walk: we will stand,
you lie down, and we will carry you." So the boy
lay down and they carried him in their hands. Four
times they became tired and laid him down. When
they came to the house they spread a woven blanket,
hat&#353;-h&#257;rke, and laid him with his head against a
post in the middle of the house. (4 songs.)</p>

house. I have many things in it." The youngest went
out and got the sack. Then the three youngest
ground corn, for they thought, "I think he is hungry."
The boy thought, "You three did not like me
before: you thought I was rotten. Now when you
grind corn and make bread or mush and give it to me
I will not eat it." They made bread (m&ocirc;&#948;&#299;lya) and
gave it to him but he would not eat. Then Taseky&ecirc;lkye,
the oldest, ground aksamta<a name="FNanchor_1_74" id="FNanchor_1_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> seeds and made
bread of them and gave them to him and he ate: he
did not eat the other bread that the three younger
sisters made. At sunset they went to bed: two of
them lay on each side of him. From each side they
tried to embrace him. He paid no attention to them
except to the oldest who lay next to him on the
right side. That night she said, "Will you stay
here and live in this house, or go away? The man
who lived here eats people. We are afraid of that.
When he goes hunting without luck, he is hungry,
and then I am afraid he will eat me; I fear that
every day." Then the boy said, "When I was north I
told my mother, 'I am going far to the south, but
I am coming back.' My mother is thinking of me,
thinking I am coming to see her. I must go north to
where she lives and stay there. I will start in the
morning."</p>

(Kway&#363;) will come back today." They said, "He has
enough to eat: plenty of people's dried meat and
people's bones ground up." The boy said, "I do not
think he will follow me. Now I am ready to start.
Are you ready?" All the women said, "Yes." He said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
"Take your baskets." Then they each took a basket.
He said, "I did not come here to gamble, I

his house, his property, and you, and I won you
too. It was not I who wanted to gamble, it was
he." Then they went east on the desert along a
valley. After a while he stood still with the
four women. He thought, "When I am traveling,
women make too much trouble. They do not travel
fast. If I kill them, I can go fast. I think I
will make it rain on them and they may die. It
will become cold and they will freeze and die
from that." (2 songs, about clouds.)</p>

heavily and continued to rain. They went farther
and the water was deep. The four women were wet.
Their clothes were wet and they could not go
fast. The boy thought, "Some men do wrong. I was
thinking something bad. It is not right: I do
not like it. I said of Kway&#363; that his was a bad
way. I do not want to do anything bad. That is
what I said, but now I am doing a bad thing. I
brought a heavy rain and made the four women wet.
I will stop the rain. If the rain stops and the
sun shines, the women will sit for awhile and
their dresses will become dry; then we will start
again and go on." He thought like this and the
rain stopped, and they sat and rested. (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para84" id="ch01para84"></a>84. They sat in the shade with their clothes
off hanging in a tree to dry. When their clothes
were dry they went on again. There was much mud
from the rain. Their sandals (haminyo)<a name="FNanchor_1_76" id="FNanchor_1_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> were
full of mud. The boy ran around the women. "Your

striped. The bird saw the boy and came flying
toward him. He said, "This bird is my mother's.

house at sunset. He took the bird, put it down
at the door, and stood to one side. The bird
walked around at the door, and made a noise. The
woman came out and saw the boy. "My son, it is
you," she said. "Yes, it is I," he told her. She
said, "I thought you had died long ago. I thought
somebody had killed you. You have dreamed well:
I did not think I would see you again." She
embraced him and cried. The four women stood off,
looking at them. (2 songs.)</p>

took their ball. When I got it I went back to my
house and struck it to the west with my shinny
stick. The ball fell in the mountains and broke
them, killing many people. Then I said to the old
man, 'My uncle, I am going to leave you. I am going
to follow my mother. I am going to go to her
house. If I am not sick I will come back to see
you.' That is what I told the old man. Then I left
and saw many dangerous things, rattlesnakes and
other dangers, but I was not afraid. I saw animals
and people but I overcame them all. I came to Sun's
house. When I came there this woman knew what I
would be like. She saved me. No one knew me, but
she knew me. I killed Sun and turned him into the
sun, to be two suns. I did that; then I came here.
I myself killed my uncle (the sun): no one else did
it." (1 song.)<a name="FNanchor_1_78" id="FNanchor_1_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

On being asked the mother's name, the narrator
said it was Kuvah&#257;; that the dead father's first
wife's name was T&#353;ese'ilye, and that the two were
half-sisters, daughters of Sun by different mothers.
Apparently either I or my experienced interpreter
misunderstood on T&#353;ese'ilye's first mention,
and recorded "T&#353;ese'ilye's daughter" instead of
"T&#353;ese'ilye, Sun's daughter" (note <a href="#Footnote_1_14">14</a>). However,
it is also possible that names and relationships
changed in the narrator's mind. His story was recorded
for three days, with an empty day's interval.
In any event, it is clear that names mean
little to the Mohave in these narratives: they
talk chiefly in terms of boy, old man, woman,
brother, etc. Cf. note <a href="#Footnote_1_87">87</a>.</p>

mother said, "You have come far and are tired. You
have stood long and your legs are tired. Sit down.
I have corn and wheat. Grind it and make mush or
eat it whatever way you like. Take as much as you
want." Then the oldest of his wives went into the
house and took corn and parched it. The three other
sisters were ashamed and stood with their heads
hanging. His mother put her hands on them, saying,
"My daughters-in-law." (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para90" id="ch01para90"></a>90. When Sun<a name="FNanchor_1_79" id="FNanchor_1_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> came home, his daughter (the
boy's mother) told him what her son had told her.
She said, "He says he has killed Sun and turned him
into the sun. He has made him be two suns." Then
the old man, the boy's grandfather, said, "If he
has killed him, it is well. Even though it was his
kinsman, it is well. If a relative is bad and is
killed it is right." Then the boy asked him, "Are
there any dangerous things to the east?" He said,
"Yes: thunder and lightning. One cannot do anything
to them. Look out!" The boy wanted them to kill
somebody with. He wanted to make them be something
to take with him when he went to war. So
they talked that night. In the morning he rolled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
up his blanket and carried it on his back, going
east. He did not say where he was going. When he
was gone, his mother asked his wife, "Did you
hear him say anything? Did he tell you?" His
wife said, "I heard him say, 'When I come to my
mother's house, Sun's house, I will not stay because
I do not know the old man there.' That is
all I heard him say." Meanwhile the boy went on
east. (2 songs.)</p>

boy had chased to the sky and turned into the

into a hole made by lightning when it struck the
ground. In the hole he found a (piece of) cane.
Then he split it with his fingernail into four
splints. (2 songs.)<a name="FNanchor_1_80" id="FNanchor_1_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

The only words in the two songs are: &#299;&#948;auk,
I hold; kwat&#353;a, a chief in the north (note <a href="#Footnote_1_82">82</a>);
hany&ocirc;, enter hole; o&#948;ik, I bring. These words
are considerably twisted and added to by meaningless
syllables like -ngau.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para92" id="ch01para92"></a>92. When he had that cane, he brought it back
to his mother's house, at noon. He carried it in
a bundle and hung it outdoors. His wife gave him
to eat. That night he said nothing. In the morning
the woman wanted to see what he had got. He
said, "If I show it to you you will all die
quickly. So I will not show it to you: I will put
it away." Next day he said, "You know what they
did to me long ago.<a name="FNanchor_1_81" id="FNanchor_1_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> I am going to have war with
them. I am alone, but I am going, going north."
The women said, "If you go, we will go." Sun said,
"I will stay." The boy was going to war with Pukehane,
Nume-peta, Tinya-kwa&#952;pi, and Kwat&#353;a-kwat&#353;a.<a name="FNanchor_1_82" id="FNanchor_1_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
In the morning they started. (1 song.)</p>

The two last are mentioned here for the first
time. The Mohave like groups of four. Tinya-m is
"night." Kwat&#353;a-kwat&#353;a's name, unreduplicated,
occurs in the songs about getting the lightning-cane
(note <a href="#Footnote_1_80">80</a>).</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para93" id="ch01para93"></a>93. They went north. T&#353;ese'ilye had also had
a boy.<a name="FNanchor_1_83" id="FNanchor_1_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> That boy said, "I am wise too. I have
dreamed well: I know everything." He called himself
Ahta-kwasume.<a name="FNanchor_1_84" id="FNanchor_1_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> He gave himself that name:
no one else gave it to him. Around his neck he
wore cane, and he wore it on his belt and in his
ears. When he walked, the cane in front and behind
him rattled. Now he went east: He came to
Hat&#353;akwanakwe. There he burned the grass<a name="FNanchor_1_85" id="FNanchor_1_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and
stayed, wanting to see his half-brother from the
south. Then that one from the south came. Ahta-kwasume
had a little fire over which he was
stooping and did not see him. Then when he saw
him he did not know him: he thought he was of
some other tribe and not his brother. He was
afraid and ran off east, and the other chased him,
saying, "You do not know who I am: I am your
brother." That one continued to run; at last he
stood and waited; he saw it was his brother, and
they talked. He went back with him to where the
women were. (The one from the south) said; "You
are my brother. I did not think I should see you.
You did not expect to see me, did you? I met you
on the desert. How do you live?" (1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para94" id="ch01para94"></a>94. "Who are you? Whose boy are you?" he said.
Ahta-kwasume did not say, but asked him the same.
He also would not tell. Then Ahta-kwasume sang.
In the song he mentioned his father's (<i>sic</i>) name.
Then the one who had come from the south said,
"I stand on Hatpa-'aqwao&#952;t&#353;e" (circumlocution for:
he is kin of my father).<a name="FNanchor_1_86" id="FNanchor_1_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> (1 song by each of

south, said, "We met here. We will cry together
for a little while." Then they took hot&#363; paint;<a name="FNanchor_1_88" id="FNanchor_1_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
with that they painted. Then they cried. They
burned their clothes and their baskets and all
they had;<a name="FNanchor_1_89" id="FNanchor_1_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> but Ahta-hane did not burn the cane

Here at last we have the name of our boy
hero. The narrator gave it when he was asked it
at this point. When asked previously, in the
part of the story where the boy is coming near
Yuma tribal territory in his southward travels,
the narrator said that as yet he had no name.</p>

finally brings on this expression of emotion.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para96" id="ch01para96"></a>96. He sprinkled water on the ashes and walked
on the ashes and made the ground open wide in
four places. Their father was deep down and they
wanted him to come up. They heard him come. He
continued to come and they heard him nearer. Soon
he emerged. He had no bones, only flesh.<a name="FNanchor_1_90" id="FNanchor_1_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The
two boys embraced him and cried. Ahta-kwasume sat
to the west of him, Ahta-hane to the east. (2
songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<h4>J. Revenge on Father's Foes</h4>

<p><a name="ch01para97" id="ch01para97"></a>97. Ahta-hane said, "You cannot walk. You cannot
come with me. I wanted to see you, to see
your face and your body. That is all. I am going
north." Their father said, "It is well. I have
seen you both." Soon he went back (down), he who
had been T&#353;it&#353;uvare. Then the two brothers and
the women went north. They went north until they
came to Selye'aya-kum&#299;t&#353;e.<a name="FNanchor_1_91" id="FNanchor_1_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> They stood there.
Then Ahta-hane saw dust in the north, and his
father's scalp tied on a pole, and the wind raising
the dust.<a name="FNanchor_1_92" id="FNanchor_1_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> (1 song.)</p>

Nume-peta and Kwat&#353;a-kwat&#353;a and Tinya-kwa&#952;pi,
who were living at Avikwame with many people.
Then Pukehane and Nume-peta sent Kwat&#353;a-kwat&#353;a
to the two boys to say that they wanted to meet
them: he came southward and met them at Qara'&ecirc;rve.<a name="FNanchor_1_93" id="FNanchor_1_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
They said, "Tell them that we shall be

A mile or so northeast of Fort Mohave.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para99" id="ch01para99"></a>99. Kwat&#353;a-kwat&#353;a said, "All have heard that
you are coming. All know it: the news was brought
to them. When you arrive they want to try something
with you. There is a large rock with roots
far down in the ground. Takse<a name="FNanchor_1_94" id="FNanchor_1_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> has dug under
the rock and broken the roots. He is to roll it,
pick it up in his hand, and put it back where it
belongs. There is another: Halye'anek&#299;t&#353;e:<a name="FNanchor_1_95" id="FNanchor_1_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> he
will obey you. Your father's scalp is on the
pole: he will climb up to get it. If he can bring
it down, we shall lose, but if he cannot bring it
we shall win." The two boys said, "The people who
live in the north do not think as we do. They
ridicule me because they have killed my father.
We shall arrive about noon." Then Kwat&#353;a-kwat&#353;a
went back. (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch01para100" id="ch01para100"></a>100. That day they went up the river and came
near the others. Halye'anek&#299;t&#353;e went to meet
them. He said, "I will climb up to get the scalp.
If you win you will get everything, their clothes,
the men and women, the boys and the girls. But if
I climb and cannot bring down the scalp, you will
lose your bodies and everything you have. Then
again, if Takse can dig under the large rock and
cut its roots and carry it and throw it, you will
lose, but if he cannot move the rock, you will
win. You will win the houses, the dishes, and all
the property of those people." Now Hatpa-'aqwao&#952;t&#353;e
wanted to see the two boys. He said, "I want to
see my two nephews." He met them, embraced them,
and felt them over.<a name="FNanchor_1_96" id="FNanchor_1_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> (1 song.)</p>

Tactifying his emotion, as it were. He did
not cry, the narrator said.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para101" id="ch01para101"></a>101. Now the two boys came there.<a name="FNanchor_1_97" id="FNanchor_1_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Then they
argued what they should do first. The two boys
wanted Halye'anek&#299;t&#353;e to make his trial first.
The people who lived there wanted Takse to be
first. Then Takse tried first. He took the rock,
but could not throw it and it fell down just
where he stood. So the people who lived there
lost. Now Halye'anek&#299;t&#353;e was ready to climb: they
told him to try. He climbed and brought down the
scalp. So the two boys won again. The people there
had lost everything. But they did not give up
everything that they had lost; they gave up only
part. They gave up their clothes and dishes and
property but they did not give up their bodies.
(1 song.)</p>

Where the others lived "at Avikwame" or
Avi-mota (note <a href="#Footnote_1_98">98</a>). Subsequently, the narrator
said that when he threw his fire, the hero stood
at T&#353;ohatave and &#948;okup&#299;ta-tu&#948;&#363;mpe, two spots at
the east end of Avi-mota. Presumably this is
where the contest took place. It is not clear
why the localization of this important scene
was not given spontaneously.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch01para102" id="ch01para102"></a>102. Then they said they wanted to bet again.
They wanted to bet their bodies. They too had
lightning. Ahta-hane's lightning (horrave) was
not like theirs. They said to him, "Show yours."
He said, "No, show yours." Then they showed it.
It was only light and did no harm. Then he showed
his: it was brighter than theirs, and quick, and
struck the ground, and entered it. So he won
everything that they had bet. Then he started to
go away. But before that he had sent the five
women back, his four wives and his mother; and
Hatpa-'aqwao&#952;t&#353;e and Axta-hane (<i>sic</i>, for Ahta-kwasume);
seven people in all. Now, when he went,
he took one of his four pieces of cane and threw
it west over Avi-mota.<a name="FNanchor_1_98" id="FNanchor_1_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> It burned up everything
and killed every one: Pukehane, Nume-peta,
Kwat&#353;a-kwat&#353;a, Tinya-kwa&#952;pi, and their people.
Then he ran to the south. The fire had nearly
overtaken his seven people. Only a plant like bulrushes,
nyave&#948;i-ny-ipa, ghost arrow, did not burn.
It stopped the fire at I &#333;-kuva'ire and saved
those seven people. (2 songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_98" id="Footnote_1_98"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_1_98">[98]</a></span>
It was on Avi-mota, not on Avikwame, that
these people lived, the narrator said later, in
explanation. Cf. note <a href="#Footnote_1_97">97</a>.</p>
</div>


<h4>K. Transformation</h4>

<p><a name="ch01para103" id="ch01para103"></a>103. Ahta-hane had made this plant grow. Now
his brother stood by him, and Hatpa-'aqwao&#952;t&#353;e,
and the five women in a row. They wanted to know
what he would do. He took off the covering of his
cane, showed it to them, put the pieces of cane
together between his hands, and it thundered. He
wanted to turn them into something. Then the five
women flew up to the sky. They stayed there and
were the Pleiades, hat&#353;a. Then he wanted to do
something for his brother. "I think it will be
best if I take him to a little lake full of mud
and throw him in to be a bird and he will shake
his head, and we shall call him teristeris."<a name="FNanchor_1_99" id="FNanchor_1_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Then he did that, and now Ahta-kwasume was that
sort of a bird. Then he wanted to do something
with the old man, Hatpa-'aqwao&#952;t&#353;e. He thought,
"I will throw him into the same place. I want him
to be called so&#952;&ecirc;rqe."<a name="FNanchor_1_100" id="FNanchor_1_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Then he did that with
the old man. (10 songs.)</p>

</div>

<p><a name="ch01para104" id="ch01para104"></a>104. Now he alone was left. No one was there.
He thought, "What am I going to be? I think I will
fly up and go through the air. I will be a meteor,
kway&#363;,<a name="FNanchor_1_101" id="FNanchor_1_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and fly into the sea." Then he
changed his mind. He thought, "No, I will not go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
into the sea. When I fly up I will go south."
Then he went south. Just below Mukiampeve is
Kway-&#363;-namau,<a name="FNanchor_1_102" id="FNanchor_1_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> where Kway&#363;'s father's mother
had turned to rock. He went by there southward
a little, jumped into the water, and sank to
the bottom, to stay there. But, "I do not think
it is good here," he said, came out, and went to
the east side of the river. There he sat down.
He is sticking up there now. He has been there
forever, turned to rock. We call it M&ecirc;koa&#7789;a.

<h3><a name="chap01s3" id="chap01s3"></a>SONG SCHEME AND NARRATIVE OUTLINE</h3>

<p>As usual for Mohave myths, a list of song
topics also provides a sort of skeleton or framework
of the story, and, although somewhat imperfectly,
it serves conveniently as an outline of
the plot.</p>

<p>The list that follows is in a sense the informant's.
Wherever he said: "one song," or "four
songs here," a paragraph has been terminated.
The sections thus indicated by him normally deal
with a single episode or thought, and are presented
as consecutively numbered paragraphs. The
only departure I have made from this procedure
has been to break a paragraph into "a" and "b"
when its first part consists of the conclusion
of an incident without songs, and its second
part deals with a new incident to which there
are songs; as, <a href="#ch01para1a">1a</a>, <a href="#ch01para1b">1b</a>,
<a href="#ch01para7a">7a</a>, <a href="#ch01para7b">7b</a>, etc. This minor
formal device in the interest of clarity in the
outline of the tale makes it that there are 111
actual paragraphs of narrative as against 104
numbered ones.</p>

<p>The informant listed 182 songs as due to be
sung at the 104 stations or stages of incident:
an average of less than two per station. This
is low for Mohave song-narratives. There was
only a single song for 54 stations, or more than
half of them. He sang two songs at 38 stations,
three at five, four and five at three each, and
ten songs only once, at the next to final incident
of the story.</p>

<p>The narrative breaks naturally into sections
or chapters of unequal length. To these I have
given titles, and have entered these captions,
for convenience of orientation, both in the text
of the narrative and in the song scheme outline.
The latter follows.</p>

<h3><a name="chap01s4" id="chap01s4"></a>MOVEMENT OF THE NARRATIVE</h3>

<p>Bluebird was a competent narrator in making
his story move while retaining concrete and vivid
detail. There is not the actionlessness of Raven,
the bald outline manner of Vinimulye-p&#257;t&#353;e, the
constant self-communing of Deer, or the deliberate
repetitive prolixity of Mastamho. The tale always
progresses. Either there are incidents crowding
into a situation of emotional interest; or, when
this flags, as in a long journey, the stages of
travel are passed through with conciseness. The
direct story appeal of Cane seems to me greater
than that of the other Mohave narratives here
presented.</p>


<h3><a name="chap01s5" id="chap01s5"></a>APPARENT INCONSISTENCIES</h3>

<p>There are a number of internal inconsistencies
or contradictions. Some of these are almost certainly
due to misunderstandings by either the
interpreter or myself; for others I strongly suspect
the narrator to be responsible; but in any
given case it is almost impossible to be sure.
After all, the story is so long that it took
three days to tell and English it, and these
three days were interrupted by a fourth. There
was thus much provocation for the narrator to
change his plot in spots through forgetting what
he had said before.</p>

<p>One of these doubts concerns whether T&#353;ese'ilye
is the name of T&#353;it&#353;uvare's first wife from the
west or of her father (cf. n. <a href="#Footnote_1_14">14</a>); also that
T&#353;it&#353;uvare also married Sun's daughter in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
east; that this woman went home after T&#353;it&#353;uvare
died, whereas T&#353;ese'ilye gave birth to the hero
Ahta-hane (<a href="#ch01para29">29-31</a>), who in <a href="#ch01para35">35</a> sends her off to
the west; but in <a href="#ch01para82b">82b</a> following, he travels <em>eastward</em>
(after having gone south and east!) to meet
his mother, whose father is Sun (<a href="#ch01para90">90</a>): which
would make her the second wife. See footnotes <a href="#Footnote_1_14">14</a>,
<a href="#Footnote_1_35">35</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_36">36</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_52">52</a>,
<a href="#Footnote_1_54">54</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_58">58</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_63">63</a>,
<a href="#Footnote_1_68">68</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_75">75</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_78">78</a>,
<a href="#Footnote_1_79">79</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_83">83</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_87">87</a>.</p>

<p>There are two Suns (<a href="#ch01para11a">11a</a>, <a href="#ch01para90">90</a>; <a href="#ch01para77">77</a>, <a href="#ch01para78">78</a>). Analogous
is the fact that the hero strikes his
shinny ball away as a meteor (<a href="#ch01para37">37</a>), overcomes
Kway&#363;, the cannibal Meteor (<a href="#ch01para75">75</a>, <a href="#ch01para76">76</a>), and flies
off as a meteor himself on his way to his final
transformation, <a href="#ch01para104">104</a>.</p>

<p>Relationship terms are not always used consistently.
See especially <a href="#ch01para75">75-77</a>, footnotes <a href="#Footnote_1_58">58</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_60">60</a>,
<a href="#Footnote_1_62">62-64</a>. However, we do not know how strict and
consistent Mohave usage in daily life is. In <a href="#ch01para11b">11b</a>,
Sun's daughter, T&#353;it&#353;uvare's second wife, has a
tame cock, kwaluyauve, as her pet, but in <a href="#ch01para86">86</a> it
is a masohwa&#7789; bird; or, if in <a href="#ch01para86">86</a> the woman is
T&#353;ese'ilye, T&#353;it&#353;uvare's first wife, the change
is from a hwet&#353;e-hwet&#353;e bird in <a href="#ch01para7b">7b</a> to a masohwat.</p>

<p>In <a href="#ch01para2">2</a> and <a href="#ch01para3">3</a>, the two brothers are said to have
gone north only a short distance from their
origin at Avikwame. They must however have proceeded
farther, and then have turned to the south,
as may be inferred from what follows. Thus, in <a href="#ch01para37">37</a>,
the younger brother's son goes north from where
his father was killed and he was born, to Avi-kwutap&#257;rva,
crosses the Colorado river there, and
then goes downstream a little on the east side
to I&#948;&ocirc;-kuva'ire and Qara'&ecirc;rve, all three places
being in northern Mohave valley near Fort Mohave.&mdash;The
evil older brother is at Avikwame, according
to <a href="#ch01para5">5</a>, <a href="#ch01para24">24</a>, <a href="#ch01para28">28</a>, <a href="#ch01para98">98</a>, when his nephew hero
returns, but is killed by him at Avi-mota in <a href="#ch01para102">102</a>;
cf. footnotes <a href="#Footnote_1_97">97</a>, <a href="#Footnote_1_98">98</a>.&mdash;The hero sends his mother
away to the west in <a href="#ch01para35">35</a>, though his father got
her in the east; he starts on a long journey
south in <a href="#ch01para38">38</a>, then east along the seacoast, and
inland northeast in <a href="#ch01para68">68</a> to find his wives and his
adversaries. When he returns to his mother in
<a href="#ch01para82b">82b</a>, he ought accordingly to be going north or
northwestward, but is said to be traveling east.
Is it a case of a slip of the narrator's mind,
of the interpreter's tongue, or of my pencil? Or
possibly did the hero follow an indirect course
which escaped mention? An emendation might simplify
the situation&mdash;such as assuming an intended
"east" for recorded "west" when the mother was
sent away in <a href="#ch01para35">35</a>; but there would be no control
of the guesses. And it may well be that as much
contradiction as this is expectable in so long
a narrative acquired supposedly by dreaming, retained
without mnemonic device, and probably told
only a very few times in a life.</p>

<p>In any event, none of these discrepancies of factual
statement, if they are discrepancies, seriously
affect the plot interest, the feeling tone, or the
hearer's ability to participate in the story.</p>

<p>The main defect in the Cane plot, from our
point of view, is the long preliminary, A to D.
A full quarter of the tale&mdash;to be exact, three-tenths
of its length, 28 out of 104 song groups or
stages, and 42 of 182 songs&mdash;precedes the hero's
birth. This makes a narrative long enough for interest
to get well established in the hero's father,
and it has then to be rebuilt around the son. However,
the story can also be viewed as a sort of
epic covering two lifetimes, with the second generation
recuperating the losses of the first and
revenging it. In a definitely sophisticated art,
the reverses of the first life would presumably
be only sketched, or suggested by implication, and
the action could then be developed around the chief
hero's career or its climax. The Cane situation
is somewhat like that in the Nibelungenlied, where
the story of Siegfried's exploits about balances
that of the revenge for his death: as an introduction,
the first half is too long and autonomous;
as an epilogue to a life, the second half is much
too long and heavily charged. The imbalance in the
mediaeval German epic is obvious as a defect and
has led to discussion of whether in its present
form it is not a secondary joining of two poems
originally distinct. Similarly, the history of the
accretion of the Cane story might conceivably have
been partly traceable from comparison of a series
of versions. But these have not been recorded and
are presumably no longer remembered, at least
hardly in unmutilated form.</p>

<p>The very brief first section, A, with the
reference to Kamaiav&ecirc;ta, is the normal Mohave way
of giving the story its placement in the scheme
of things by tying it into the cosmogony. Kamaiav&ecirc;ta
or Sky-rattlesnake was killed for being
thought to have caused the death by witchcraft of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
Matavilya, the child of Heaven and Earth and
first great god. This dates the Cane story as
happening right after the beginnings, ties it to
the sacred spots Ha'avulypo and Avikwame, and
endows it with weight and authenticity. That
this is pure preliminary is shown by the fact
that there are no songs.</p>

<p>In our next section B, the brothers drift
off, discover things, build a house, find a
living, and are joined by their uncle. In short,
they grope and become partially established.
This is good Mohave story pattern. The pairing,
in place of a single hero, occurs again in Raven,
in Coyote, in Deer; and in other myths. But so
far there is nothing very eventful in the plot:
it is only slowly getting started.</p>

<p>Part C has the brothers get themselves wives,
at their uncle's instigation. The plot is beginning
to have "human interest." And yet it remains
quite "decorative": there are four girls in four
directions, each living alone with a pet bird in
a cage, the approach is through the bird, then
the brothers struggle for the girl, and bring
her home. Still, the repetition is not formally
exact, as it would be in a ritual, or as in the
myths of some other tribes; no two of the four
episodes are told quite alike, and each contains
certain unique incidents. The brothers' quarreling
for the girls foreshadows what is to come;
just as it is faintly pre-anticipated by their
childish arrow betting in paragraph <a href="#ch01para6">6</a> of the preceding
part. The younger is the stronger and wins
the two first girls; and though the elder gets
the next two on sufferance, a grievance is thereby
set up. This is not dwelled on, but helps to motivate
what follows.</p>

<p>Part D. They go for cane, apparently as a
source of power, and quarrel over it. The older
almost kills the younger, but relents, concedes
him what he wants, but then bewitches him. Omens
of doom pile up effectively. The victim's state
of mind may be an example of what a Mohave feels
who believes himself bewitched. The magic operating
too slowly, the younger brother is finally
dispatched with the humiliation of having bones
cut out of his body for use and play. The elder
goes off with the non-kinsmen whom the uncle had
left when he joined his blood nephews. This marks
him as a traitor and Chemehuevi foreigner, as well
as establishing two inimical groups or parties.</p>

<p>With part E, dealing with the posthumous birth
of the hero, the main narrative begins. The hero
evidences prenatal magic power, but this is a
faculty often attributed by the Mohave to shamans,
so that the manifestation is mythically expectable,
rather than miraculous in our sense.</p>

<p>In the next section, F, the baby, grown to boyhood,
steals his father's bone with which his foes
are playing&mdash;compare the incident in Nyohaiva,
<a href="#ch03para15a">15</a>&mdash;and sends it flying to break the western mountains
and kill their inhabitants. It does not appear
that these people are his foes: rather is he
trying out his growing powers; and his real foes
begin to foresee their end.</p>

<p>Then he goes on a long journey which constitutes
part G. This travel is motivated by Mohave
song-myth custom rather than by anything in the
boy hero's situation. At the same time, it serves
to give a sense of his growing up, and of having
his life filled with experiences as a hero should.
The Mohave narrator is in intent the teller of a
near-epic, or of a novelistic romance, not of a
short story which aims to cut to the essence of
an action. From this point of view, the journey
rounds, or properly fills out, the plot, though
it contributes nothing vital. The incidents of the
journey&mdash;down the Colorado from northern Mohave
land to the mouth of the great river, including
detours, and southeast along the Gulf shore&mdash;are
characteristic. The traveler is awakened by birds,
frightened by a rattlesnake, sees a horsefly,
hummingbird, wild grapes, badger, jack rabbit,
springs, cane, the surf, a crane, ducks, sea
shells, and various other sights such as might
make a boy watch or wonder. There is certainly a
sense of unending interest in nature, of rapport
with it, in these Mohave itineraries&mdash;a pre-Wordsworthian
attitude, one might almost call it.</p>

<p>The narration is concise in this journey. There
are 31 stages or paragraphs&mdash;between a fourth and
a third of the whole story&mdash;and 54 songs out of
182, or the same proportion; but only about one-seventh
or one-eighth of the length of the tale.
Thus the tempo of narration is doubled during this
part; which fact contributes to the fact that its
interruption of the main action does not wear down
plot-suspense unduly. Also, it is easier to devise
long strings of simple songs of five or six words
about horseflies darting or hummingbirds on their
nests or cranes in the surf, than about dangers,
feats, and dramatic tensions such as make up the
preceding and succeeding sections.</p>

<p>As soon as Ahta-hane leaves the sea to turn
inland&mdash;part H&mdash;the character of the telling
changes. It becomes pure hero-story again, now of
fairy-tale quality. The roster of place names is
over with. We are somewhere in the desert&mdash;presumably
in the Papaguer&iacute;a&mdash;but places and distances
are undesignated. This is perhaps the most interesting
part of the tale, in incidents and affects
as well as in glimpses of unsuspected ethnography.
The events comprise:</p>

<div class="list">
<p class="hang">The hero hides himself from the four women.</p>

<p class="hang">Lets himself be found rotten but is restored.</p>

<p class="hang">Wins encounter with Meteor.</p>

<p class="hang">Wins gambling with Sun.</p>

<p class="hang">Through his winning makes himself attractive to his wives.</p>
</div>

<p>Complex as the action is here, it is thus nevertheless
well tied together.</p>

<p>This is the longest section of Cane: about a
quarter of the total narration, and this crowded
with stirring events. But the songs of the section
constitute only about a sixth, and the song stations
or paragraphs about an eighth, of the total. There
is much happening, but little of the discrete incident
that best lends itself to singing about.</p>

<p>Section I is moderately long and describes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
journey home, but now with his wives, in order
to meet his mother, a half-brother unmentioned
before, and finally his dead father's shadow.
Kinship relations are thus in the forefront,
and most of the topography is still indefinite.
The return, as so often in Mohave story, presages
war. The hero's successive reunions, culminating
in the unique interview with his
father's spirit, build up affect toward a climax
which can end only in a contest with his
hereditary foes.</p>

<p>This contest constitutes part J, and is
characteristically brief: the Mohave seem not
to know how to dilate on a fight, even one conducted
by magic. The hero first beats his enemies
in competitions, then destroys them with
lightning from his magic cane. The narrator's
knitting together of items, and suspending them
over intervals, is evidenced by the lightning
cane, which has been acquired in paragraph <a href="#ch01para90">90</a>,
but is used only in <a href="#ch01para102">102</a>.</p>

<p>Section K, the final transformation of the
hero and his folk into stars, birds, and rocks,
is of course a conventional coda&mdash;somewhat like
the particle used in some languages, or the
tone-glide in others, to indicate end of sentence.
It means nothing specific in relation to the particular
events preceding, but without it the
tale would not be felt as having been brought to
an end.</p>

<p>This analysis perhaps helps to establish the
genuine skill of the narrator in joining, developing,
and sustaining a plot which has something
of epic quality and which in a less simple culture,
with a more specific medium than natural
prose available, might have had epic potentialities.</p>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02"></a>II. VINIMULYE-PAT&#352;E</h2>


<p>Vinim&#363;lye-p&#257;t&#353;e, more fully "Vinim&#363;lya-hap&#257;t&#353;a,"
is a song series prominent in Mohave
consciousness, perhaps because it deals with war.
I have never secured an etymology for the name.
The present version was narrated April 23, 1904,
upstream from Fort Mohave, by an old man called
Hiweik-kwini'&#299;lye, "her anus is black." He told
his tale with unusual compactness: part of a day
sufficed for his outline and the Englishing. He
mentioned the place in the story of 196 songs;
besides an indefinite group near the beginning:
"4, 5, 6, 10, 12 while they are on the way," or
"a night long, 50 songs." The whole cycle, when
sung complete in sequence as t&#353;upilyk, a "gift"
to a dying relative, takes two nights to sing,
he said. Jack Jones, was, as usual, my guide,
sponsor, and interpreter.</p>

<p>The tale is simple. The Mohave hero, Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e,
with his people, leaves his home
in the northern part of Mohave valley, for the
Providence mountains, off to the northwest in
Chemehuevi territory, and lives there a year.
There is no farming possible in this desert range,
but the story is silent on subsistence. The chief
wants to return to make war, and, after a brief
visit home, leads his people to the river at the
south end of Mohave valley, and then makes a
long detour downstream to below Ehrenberg, in
Halchidhoma land; from there they turn back until
they once more reach the foot of Mohave valley.
Nothing happens on this excursion; it is perhaps
introduced from sheer love of mental travel, or
to suggest the progress of a war party. The Mohave
in the southern half of the valley flee before
the invaders, who appropriate a set of
houses near where they had lived originally.
Here they stay a year, as is shown by his daughter,
when her feelings of modesty are hurt, running
away to the Walapai for that period. Then
they suddenly resume the march northward for a
few miles, and finally join battle with Savilyuyave,
Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e's own younger brother
and leader of the refugees, at "Hawk-nose" near
Fort Mohave. The account of this climax is quite
meager. The residents run away across the river.
Savilyuyave is killed and scalped, his daughter
is made a "slave." After the despoiling of another
group, the "Quail people," and some calling of
names across the stream, the hero and his band
return to the Providence mountains, where one of
them dies of a wound received in the battle. Why
the two halves of the Owit&#353; clan should peacefully
separate under the leadership of two brothers, and
then the returning one insist on war to a finish,
but abandon the conquered territory, is wholly unaccounted
for. Either there is motivation which
the narrator knows but considers it unnecessary
to discuss; or the motivation is as lacking as in
a dream. After all, these tales are all dreams,
the Mohave insist. And while it is clear that
they do not ordinarily invent new plots in their
dreams, they do quite probably dream over or
brood about or perhaps actually redream, each
man, the plot or plots which he calls his. The
one theme which runs through this tale as a unifying
thread is the doom of war.</p>

<p><a name="ch02para1" id="ch02para1"></a>1. Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e lived at Aha-kwa'i<a name="FNanchor_2_1" id="FNanchor_2_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with
his people. At that time the river was near that
place. He was the only one of them to talk to the
rest. Then he and his people crossed the river to
the western side to Ama&#7789;-kusayi.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (4 songs.)<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

Aha-kwa'i is at the "Old Gus" ranch, below
Milltown, on an overflow pond or slough (an old
river arm), at the foot of the mesa on the east
edge of Mohave valley, upstream from Needles and
downstream from Fort Mohave. At the time of the
story, the river lay close to Aha-kwa'i.</p>

The narrator stated that he usually omitted
the songs credited to pars. <a href="#ch02para1">1</a> and <a href="#ch02para2">2</a> and began
with those referring to the Providence mountains.
I&#952;ava is arrowweed.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch02para2" id="ch02para2"></a>2. Then they went up on the mesa, and from
there into the mountains at I&#952;ave-kukyave. (2
songs.)<a name="FNanchor_2_3a" id="FNanchor_2_3a"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3a" class="fnanchor">[3a]</a></p>

<p><a name="ch02para3" id="ch02para3"></a>3. Then they went on to the large mountains,
Avi-kwe-havasu,<a name="FNanchor_2_4" id="FNanchor_2_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the Providence mountains. (2
songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

"Blue mountains," as they appear from the
Mohave country.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch02para4" id="ch02para4"></a>4. They had found that land and kept it for
their own. They lived there a year. Now Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e
was a Mohave, and his relatives were
Mohave in this country. He said: "I want to go
back to my relatives." Then he returned by the
way he had come, going back to Aha-kwa'i with his
people. When he had returned, all the Mohave said:
"I think he has come to make war." They talked of
war. They were afraid of him, for he was very
large. Then he went back to the Providence mountains
with his people. Now he was a man who
dreamed well.<a name="FNanchor_2_5" id="FNanchor_2_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He knew what the people were saying
about him: he dreamed it. They were saying: "I
wish Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e would come again. We would
cook wheat<a name="FNanchor_2_6" id="FNanchor_2_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> for him, and put meat into it, and
make good food for him." No one sent for him to
come but he knew what they wished. Then he was
ready to come to make war. So he started with his
people, but he did not go straight. He went past
Hatalompe<a name="FNanchor_2_7" id="FNanchor_2_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> far down to Aha-kwatpave.<a name="FNanchor_2_8" id="FNanchor_2_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> (An indefinite

Later he stated that he sang of this portion of
the story "a whole night, 50 songs." The last
place mentioned by name on the way south, however,
is Hatalomve or Hatalompe.</p></div>

<p><a name="ch02para5" id="ch02para5"></a>5. From there he turned back and started

Ehrenberg. The route now is back northward
up the east bank of the river.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch02para6" id="ch02para6"></a>6. From there he started again with his people
and went upstream to Kapotake-hiv'auve.<a name="FNanchor_2_11" id="FNanchor_2_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
They slept there and went on up the river to

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_11" id="Footnote_2_11"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_2_11">[11]</a></span> No songs were mentioned for this place, perhaps
by oversight.</p></div>

<p><a name="ch02para7" id="ch02para7"></a>7. Having slept there, they went on to Avi-helye'a.
(1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch02para8" id="ch02para8"></a>8. The next day they came to Avi-kwa-hapama,
(1 song.)</p>

<p><a name="ch02para9" id="ch02para9"></a>9. From there they went on, the next morning,
until they reached Aqwaqa-have.<a name="FNanchor_2_12" id="FNanchor_2_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> There they
slept again. (5 songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_12" id="Footnote_2_12"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_2_12">[12]</a></span>
Aqwaqa means deer.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch02para10" id="ch02para10"></a>10. Starting in the morning, they went on up
to Tatasky-anve. They did not sleep there.<a name="FNanchor_2_13" id="FNanchor_2_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
But Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e talked of war. He said:
"When there is war, people are beaten and run
away. Women are captured as slaves and pushed
into the river." So they talked of what they
would do. (2 songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_13" id="Footnote_2_13"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_2_13">[13]</a></span> Possibly meaning that they went past the
place without stopping, but more probably that
they made camp and spent the night there, and
that Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e talked to his people instead
of letting them sleep.</p></div>

<p><a name="ch02para11" id="ch02para11"></a>11. Then they came to Hakut&#353;yepe.<a name="FNanchor_2_14" id="FNanchor_2_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> There
they made camp. Then they saw a beaver's track,
like a little boy's foot. They had never seen
it before and thought it was a little boy. Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e
showed it to his people and they
were afraid. In the morning they started. (10
songs.)<a name="FNanchor_2_15" id="FNanchor_2_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

Thus the narrative. In subsequently indicating
the number of songs relating to each part of
the story, the narrator made no mention of Hakut&#353;yepe
and the incident there, but proceeded as
follows: "On the way north, 4 songs. At Selye'aye-kwame,
4 songs. At Chemehuevi valley, 2 songs."
There is no discrepancy, but different events and
stages of the same part of the journey are specified
in the two accounts. It must be remembered
that the narrative is unusually condensed.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch02para11a" id="ch02para11a"></a>11a. They came to Selye'aya-ita, where they
slept. Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e told his people how
brave he was, and how good his luck was, and
what he had dreamed. (4 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch02para12" id="ch02para12"></a>12. They started up the river next day, came
to Hatu&#7789;ve and slept there. (4 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch02para13" id="ch02para13"></a>13. They went on up again. (3 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch02para14" id="ch02para14"></a>14. That night they slept at Ama&#7789;-kyerekyere-kwitni.<a name="FNanchor_2_16" id="FNanchor_2_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
(4 songs.)</p>

now at the foot of Mohave valley.</p></div>

<p><a name="ch02para15" id="ch02para15"></a>15. In the morning they came to Kwaparvete<a name="FNanchor_2_17" id="FNanchor_2_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
and stood there. The people on the west side of
the river, saw them and were afraid and ran off.
(10 songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_17" id="Footnote_2_17"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_2_17">[17]</a></span>
Kwaparvete is the name of a little mesa which
the railroad ascends and traverses after it
crosses the river and before it enters the mouth
of the Sacramento wash, by which it climbs to the
Arizona plateau.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch02para16" id="ch02para16"></a>16. Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e and his people saw them
going. He said: "Let us pursue but not kill them."
Then they followed them.<a name="FNanchor_2_18" id="FNanchor_2_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Now women shout in war.
But this time the women said: "We will not shout.
You say you will not kill them, but only chase
them; therefore there is no need for us to shout.
When you are ready to kill, we will shout." Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e
said: "We shall have war. We are not
killing these people. We do not even wish to attack
them. But there will be war." Those who fled came
to above where Needles now is. Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e
and his people followed their dust until they came
to Avi-hilykwampe.<a name="FNanchor_2_19" id="FNanchor_2_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> There the pursued crossed the
river, and Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e crossed after them.

went another way, eastward to Aha-kukwinve.<a name="FNanchor_2_20" id="FNanchor_2_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Now they were nearly at the place where they had
formerly lived.<a name="FNanchor_2_21" id="FNanchor_2_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> All the people in the vicinity
were afraid and ran northward, upriver, abandoning
their food and dishes and property. Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e's
people gathered up these effects, ate the
food, and lived there.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="ch02para18" id="ch02para18"></a>18. Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e had a daughter, Ilya-owit&#353;-maikohwere.
He said: "Now that you are big
enough, do not sleep near me. Sleep at a distance.
Sleep in the corner of the house."<a name="FNanchor_2_22" id="FNanchor_2_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Then the girl
was angry at his saying that and ran off. (4 songs.)</p>

He wanted her to have a lover and marry, and
feared that no man would steal to her while she
lay close to her parents. There is nothing disgraceful
in this suggestion, to the Mohave, who
scarcely make a distinction between lover and
husband. The old people frequently exhort the
young to enjoy themselves while they can.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch02para19" id="ch02para19"></a>19. She went east until she came to Hawi, where
she slept. Then she went on to Avi-hoalye, the
Walapai mountains.<a name="FNanchor_2_23" id="FNanchor_2_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> There were many girls among
the (Walapai) people living there, and she played

it there. (30 songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_23" id="Footnote_2_23"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_2_23">[23]</a></span>
Hoalye means yellow pine. The name Walapai,
hawaly-ipai in Mohave, seems to be derived from
this word.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch02para20" id="ch02para20"></a>20. After a year she went back. When she returned,
she was ashamed and sat outside the
house. She did not go indoors to her parents.
She was painted red. The people she had been
with, the Walapai, had given her the paint. The
Mohave do not paint like that. So they did not
know who she was. She sat with her head bowed.
Then Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e came out. "That is my
daughter," he said. (10 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch02para21" id="ch02para21"></a>21. He said to her: "I thought you had died.
When a woman visits her friends among another
tribe, she stays two months or three months.
You stayed a year and I thought you were dead."
Then, after four days, Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e said:
"Now it is four days. I am ready to fight. The
people I am going to attack do not live very
far away. But I think my daughter is tired. Have
you become tired?" But Ilya-owit&#353;-maikohwere
said: "No, I am not tired. I will go with you."
When they came to Ama&#7789;-tasilyke and A&#952;'i-kupome,
the people whom they had pursued before and who
had fled there and were still living there, saw
them, and took their property and fled north
once more. They ran to Sokwilye-ihu.<a name="FNanchor_2_24" id="FNanchor_2_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> There they
lay down for the night. Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e and
his people slept at Selye'aye-'it&#353;-pat&#353;e,<a name="FNanchor_2_25" id="FNanchor_2_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> downriver
from them. Then Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e named a
mesa near by: Havateit&#353;e-'isnave. (40 songs.)</p>

his younger brother, was the head man among those
who had fled. When Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e and his
people came to Sokwilye-'ihu, they fought. Soon
Savilyuyave's people ran away and jumped into
the river. Savilyuyave himself was killed in the
river. He sank to the bottom and they seized him,
dragged him on the bank, and scalped him. His
daughter<a name="FNanchor_2_27" id="FNanchor_2_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> they took as a slave. Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e's

Owit&#353; is one of the women's clan-names.
As Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e and Savilyuyave
were brothers, and of the Owit&#353; group, their
daughters would both be named Owit&#353;. In reply to
a question, the informant stated decisively that
all the people accompanying Umas-kwit&#353;it-pat&#353;e
called their daughters Owit&#353;, showing that he
regarded them as a clan. The totemic reference
of the clan is to clouds.</p>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a>III. NYOHAIVA</h2>


<h3><a name="chap03s1" id="chap03s1"></a>CIRCUMSTANCES AND NATURE OF THE STORY</h3>

<p>In November, 1905, my friend and interpreter
Jack Jones came to San Francisco and the University,
bringing with him an informant called
Aspa-sakam, which means Eagle-sell. Aspa-sakam
was a youngish middle-aged man, heavy-set and
inclined to be fat, who worked pretty steadily
for the Santa Fe railroad at Needles. He was,
however, a good Mohave inwardly, and had dreamt
and could sing two cycles, Yellaka or Goose, and
Nyohaiva (Ny&ocirc;'haiva), which is a story of war
but named after an insect. He narrated both of
these, proving himself an excellent informant as
regards precision, orderliness of mind, and
willingness to explain. His Goose story has been
outlined on pages 766-768 of the Handbook of
California Indians. It is a very long tale with
a minimum of action. The Nyohaiva story, which
follows here, is much shorter. The songs, as
their scheme was outlined and as they were recorded
on the phonograph in part, aggregate only
about a hundred, as against four hundred or
more in the Goose series. Aspa-sakam said that
it took only one night to sing the Nyohaiva
series through.</p>

<p>Nyohaiva, the narrator said, was known also
to an old man called Mehulye, who was his mother's
brother and who now lived with him. This
was a paralyzed man who knew the Great Tale,
the story of migrations and battles of Mohave
clan groups.</p>

<p>As regards Goose, Aspa-sakam said that this
was known also to his brother and to an old man,
Hakwe, who was his father-in-law and therefore
not a blood relation. The narrator added that
perhaps sometime he would teach the singing to
his son. The old man, Hakwe, was subsequently
interviewed at Needles. I shrank from obtaining
from him the whole of the story, having already
gone through the ordeal of securing it from
Aspa-sakam, but did record some of the songs and
a place-name synopsis of the story, which is
given on pages 768-769 of the Handbook. This
outline shows Hakwe's version of Goose to be
quite different in detail from Aspa-sakam's. The
songs also have a different melodic theme. It
does not seem, therefore, that either of these
two informants, son-in-law and father-in-law,
could have learned from, or been very much influenced
by, the other.</p>

<p>As for Nyohaiva, Aspa-sakam subsequently
said that his kin on the father's side knew
Nyohaiva. As a boy he heard them sing it and
learned it. "They did not teach me, for such
things cannot be taught. They can only be
dreamed. But my relatives knew Nyohaiva, and I
dreamed it." These are his own words, and, semi-contradictory
as they may seem to us, they perhaps
come as close as is possible to expressing
a characteristic Mohave nondifferentiation of
spontaneous development from within and acquisition
from without. Aspa-sakam added that the way
he came to know Goose was different: none of his
kinsfolk knew this. In our words, he really
dreamed this; Nyohaiva he both learned and dreamed.
When he was a boy, sometimes he would sing parts
of Goose. An old man, hearing him sing, would say:
"Yes, that is right. Yes, that is Goose." So he
acquired more of it, dreaming it, and came to sing
more and more of it.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether he had ever sung either
Goose or Nyohaiva through consecutively at any one
time or occasion. I had seen him about two years
earlier at a death and cremation, where he was
singing, probably Nyohaiva. He had sung Goose for
amusement at night at his home, he said. Neither
he nor the interpreter seemingly could be made to
understand clearly my questions whether he had
ever sung Goose a whole night through, or whether
he had ever sung it or Nyohaiva continuously from
beginning to end. Such a statement of factual
events seems to have little meaning to the Mohave.</p>

<p>Nyohaiva is sung standing, at any rate when
women dance in a ring around the singer. He leans
on a stick, which he sometimes thrusts forward and
waves to the rhythm of his song, sometimes drops
through his hand to strike the ground. There is no
rattle or musical instrument.</p>

<p>Nyohaiva is classed by the Mohave as one of
their song-myths dealing with war, and its plot is
simple. Nyohaiva is an insect. She comes into existence
as a woman in the north end of Mohave
valley, at Miakwa'orve, above Fort Mohave, at the
time of the beginnings: "The world was still wet."
There is however no reference in the tale to Matavilya's
death, Ha'avulypo, Avikwame, or the actually
originating events. Nyohaiva travels south
along the river, naming places and encountering
named personages, but without notable happenings,
as far as Aqw&#257;qa-have, in Halchidhoma territory,
below Parker. Here four brothers, including Ot&#353;&ocirc;uta,
believe that she comes for war and plan to kill
her first. She on her part finds bones which she
recognizes as her relatives'&mdash;a characteristic
Mohave motivation and inconsistency&mdash;and bets her
body against her freedom in a game to be played
with one of the same bones. She wins, threatens
them with war, and runs off southward, announcing
impending war to those whom she meets, as far as
Ava-t&#353;ohai, somewhere between Parker and Yuma.
There she incites the people, under the leadership
of men whose names denote blackbirds, to join
her in returning and attacking Ot&#353;&ocirc;uta's people.
There is no reason given, why they should do so;
rather, war is treated as something which, now
given its roots, grows and will be&mdash;a sort of
gathering fate, though a stirring and pleasurable
one. The prolix Mohave narrative manner of adding
incident to incident makes for an effect of slow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
accumulation of feeling on this theme. However,
the war itself resolves into the killing by magic
of a single leader: Homeric battles are not a
usual part of the story pattern of the Mohave,
in spite of their preoccupation with war. With a
magic ball Nyohaiva puts the enemy settlement
to sleep, enters Ot&#353;&ocirc;uta's house, cuts off his
head. This she carries upriver to Samo'okusa or
Ama&#7789;-ya'ama near Parker, where people are living
under the leadership of four transvestites! She
institutes the scalp dance for them; throws
Ot&#353;&ocirc;uta's skull far south to become a rock at
Picacho in Yuma land; then turns herself to
stone as Hawk-rock, east of Parker.</p>

<p>The objective towards which the events of the
tale trend seems to be the institution of the
victory scalp dance; at which, in actual Mohave
practice, Nyohaiva was one of several singings
that were sung and danced to. In this dance, too,
transvestites&mdash;the word means coward as well&mdash;participated
along with women; and there was the
expectable heterosexual indulgence. Hence probably
the astounding berdache chiefs of the tale:
they are imagined in order to provide the fitting
dance setting. The scalp celebration seems to
have been the principal Mohave occasion for
dancing.</p>

<p>Nyohaiva, as a woman, herself reflects this
peculiar relation between women and war: her
hair, her skirt, her bashfulness are specified.
But there is also the opposite attitude: she
incites, she wants revenge, she kills. Here she
is almost the embodiment of the hwami, the occasional
female active homosexual whom the Yuman
river tribes recognize as the counterpart of the
more frequent male passive invert or alyha. But
she is never explicitly designated as a hwami,
nor does the tale itself allow us to interpret
her as having had defined hwami status in the
Mohave mind. Normal sex impulse or relation,
what we should call love interest, does not
enter into this story at all. It is normally
treated meagerly in Mohave mythology, in spite
of the endless sex talk and obscene humor of
Mohave daily life. When it does appear in narrative,
it is episodically. The plots as a whole
show the love incidents to be subsidiary. Thus
the Cane hero wishes a storm to rid himself of
his wives, who are delaying the revenge for which
he is traveling; and when his conscience makes
him relent, it is because his wish strikes him
as inhumane and bad in general, not because of
tender sentiments toward the wives as love-objects.
And there is rarely much sex feeling,
and never a touch of ribaldry. For instance,
the Tumanpa story is based on an incest motive,
but the theme is treated with such restraint
as scarcely to obtrude beyond the skeleton of
the plot, and never with a trace of passion. The
brother and sister are old people at the beginning
of the tale! The fact that such sex element
as enters into Nyohaiva is tinged with the
quality of inversion, suggests a definite functional
relation between inversion and war in
Mohave culture. I say inversion because its sanctioned
institutionalization largely removes it
from the realm of the perverse, at least socially
and in part psychologically.</p>

<p>Besides fighting and love-making, a third element
active in Mohave life is left out of Nyohaiva
as out of certain other stories in Mohave mythology.
This is their tribal consciousness and keen
ethnographic or international interest. All the
people encountered in the story are treated as if
they were Mohaves, or at least members of a still
undifferentiated human race leading a specifically
Mohave-type life; even though they dwell as far
away as the Yuma habitat. (There is a partial exception
in the incident when Nyohaiva detours east
into the mountains, finds a man whose name refers
to buckskin shirts, and gives him hunting arrows
to live by: thus she institutes the Walapai more
than she encounters them.) The attitude of clannish
rather than of tribal differentiation recurs in the
unpublished "Great Tale" and, in the present monograph,
in Cane (I), and explicitly in Vinim&#363;lye-p&#257;t&#353;e
(II), where the victorious attackers of the
Mohave, coming from the desert Providence mountains,
are not the Chemehuevi who historically inhabited
this range, but a separatist band of Mohave
who are represented as having settled there, contrary
to economic possibility for a farming people.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Nyohaiva geography reflects
historic international relations. The district of
the Mohave-like settlements which plot against
Nyohaiva and are vanquished by her are where the
Halchidhoma lived as recurrent objects of Mohave
and Yuma attack. However, the war party against
them comes from the south, that is, from the Yuma
direction; and the victim's head is petrified in
Yuma territory. It is possible therefore that Nyohaiva
is a variant derivative of the Av'alyunu
myth and singing which the Mohave recognize as the
Yuma equivalent of their Nyohaiva, as per the third
paragraph of the tale. That Nyohaiva herself is
made to have her origin in northern Mohave valley
and turns to stone not far from the scene of her
victory, means less, because almost all stories
move from north to south, through the vicinity of
Avikwame being the typical point of mythic departure

<h3><a name="chap03s2" id="chap03s2"></a>THE NYOHAIVA TALE</h3>

<p><a name="ch03para1" id="ch03para1"></a>1. Nyohaiva came to life at Miakwa'orve.<a name="FNanchor_3_1" id="FNanchor_3_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> That
place was the first one to be dry. All about, the
world was still wet. She thought: "I do not know
which is the best way to go. I wonder in what direction
is the best place for me, so that everyone
will know me and I can tell what I know. I have
dreamed well. I wish to tell what I know so that
everyone will understand it." Now the day and the
sun and everything else already existed. Then she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
thought: "There is the sun. It is already gone
down as far as that."<a name="FNanchor_3_2" id="FNanchor_3_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (3 songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_1" id="Footnote_3_1"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_3_1">[1]</a></span>
Opposite Fort Mohave and upstream from it;
therefore in Nevada.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_2" id="Footnote_3_2"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_3_2">[2]</a></span>
It was anya-tonya'im, afternoon.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para2" id="ch03para2"></a>2. Then she said: "Now I know what to do. I
will not go elsewhere than south. I will cross
the river and go to I&#948;&ocirc;-kuva'&#299;re."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Then, when
she came to I&#948;&ocirc;-kuva'&#299;re, she thought: "I will
tell about this place and that I am here." (2
songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_3_3">[3]</a></span>
I&#948;&ocirc;-kuva'&#299;re is upstream from Fort Mohave and
frequently mentioned. I&#948;&ocirc; is the black willow.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para3" id="ch03para3"></a>3. When she was about to start from there,
she said: "I will tell further what I know, so
that everyone will learn what I say. Let everyone
listen to me and take my words." As she said this
she took a handful of sand. "I am a person who
has dreamed well. When you Mohave sing, you will
sing Nyohaiva. There is another name for singing
that, Av'alyunu,<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but it is the Yuma who will
learn that. It will be the same singing, but I
give it another name." (1 song.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_4" id="Footnote_3_4"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_3_4">[4]</a></span>
Ava-lye means in the house. Some Mohave sing
Av'alyunu, but as something learned from the Yuma.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para4" id="ch03para4"></a>4. She said: "Well, I have told everything
here. I have finished. I will go." Then she went
to Aht&#353;y&ecirc;-aks&#257;mta.<a name="FNanchor_3_5" id="FNanchor_3_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> When she had gone a little
to the south from there she saw a hill of sand,
Selye'aya-kum&#299;t&#353;e.<a name="FNanchor_3_6" id="FNanchor_3_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Then she said: "All will
come to this place. They will come here to play
and sing and have a good time. That is how I
want you to become married."<a name="FNanchor_3_7" id="FNanchor_3_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> All the people
there looked at her, but did not know who she
was. "I am the person called Yana&#952;a-kwe-'ataye,"<a name="FNanchor_3_8" id="FNanchor_3_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
she said; "Do you not know me?" Then all said:
"Yes, we know you. We have heard of that person.
That is one who sings and from whom we learn
singing. Her name is Nyohaiva." Now they all
knew who she was. (4 songs.)</p>

This insect, of which Nyohaiva is so to speak
the impersonation, is described as being red-spotted
and as coming out of the ground when this
is dry. Hence no doubt the allusion to Nyohaiva's
place of birth being the first to become dry.
The Mohave call yana&#952;a-kwe-'at&#257;ye a "spider,"
but it spins no web. The element -ataye means
many, atai-k; yana&#952;a-, the narrator suggested,
was from &#948;anu&#952;a, tears, alluding to the spotted
appearance of the animal.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para5" id="ch03para5"></a>5. Nyohaiva said: "There are people living
below. I must go down. I want to talk to them
and teach them to sing. I want to talk to others
as well as to you." Then she went. She came to
Kamahn&#363;lye.<a name="FNanchor_3_9" id="FNanchor_3_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> When she arrived there, she said:
"I do not tell you anything else. I teach you only
singing. I do not tell you what you are to do, but
only how you are to sing." (4 songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_9" id="Footnote_3_9"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_3_9">[9]</a></span>
Kamahn&#363;lye is at the foot of the mesa (valley
edge) in Arizona, 4 miles south of Fort Mohave,
near the Lamp ranch.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para6" id="ch03para6"></a>6. She said: "That is what I teach you. Listen
to me." As yet she did not teach other tribes. She
taught only the Mohave. Then she went on downward
to Sav&ecirc;t-t&ocirc;he.<a name="FNanchor_3_10" id="FNanchor_3_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> (3 songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_10" id="Footnote_3_10"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_3_10">[10]</a></span>
Sav&ecirc;t-t&ocirc;he, a sandy place, is across the
river from Needles, due east, at the foot of the
mesa. Another place of the same name, but rocky,
is said to occur farther down the river.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para7" id="ch03para7"></a>7. As she stood there she heard someone speaking
or shouting in the east. She thought: "I hear
people to the east. I think I will go there." Thus
she said and went east. She went up over the mesa
and far up into the mountains A'&#299;-kumnau-t&#353;um&#299;.
There there was a spring, Aha-kuvilye.<a name="FNanchor_3_11" id="FNanchor_3_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Someone
lived there. She said: "I know you. Your name is
Hama&#952;&ocirc;le-viya.<a name="FNanchor_3_12" id="FNanchor_3_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Well, I will tell of your body.
I will tell about you." (4 songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_11" id="Footnote_3_11"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_3_11">[11]</a></span>
"Stinking water." She is in Walapai land
now.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_12" id="Footnote_3_12"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_3_12">[12]</a></span>
Hama&#952;&ocirc;le is a Walapai buckskin shirt; viya,
ham-vaya-k, to turn, revolve. "All will see him
as he stands in his shirt and turns about to
display it."</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para8" id="ch03para8"></a>8. Then she was ready to return. "I am going
back now," she said. She got up. Then she said
again: "You can live here by hunting, but you cannot
hunt without having the things with which to
hunt." Then she took<a name="FNanchor_3_13" id="FNanchor_3_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> a bow and four arrows and
threw them on the ground, and those living there
picked them up. "Now you are provided. You can
hunt and shoot," she said. She also took a stone
knife with a wooden handle and gave it to them,
then she started to go back. (She did not sing
about what she did there. She only instructed
those people, the Walapai.) As she returned toward
the river, everything had been made, both sky and
earth, and all was quiet and still. She thought of
that as she came, and sang about it. (4 songs.)<a name="FNanchor_3_14" id="FNanchor_3_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

She evidently returned to Sav&ecirc;t-t&ocirc;he after
her eastern excursion, for the songs are credited
to that place. Note that the songs are about the
completion and stillness of the world on her main
journey, not about the episodic side trip of instituting
Walapai customs.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para9" id="ch03para9"></a>9. Now she went downstream along the edge of
the river. She said: "The way that I have come will
be a trail. I am making a trail for people. When
they want to go, they will travel by this." It was
when she came to Hot&#363;rveve<a name="FNanchor_3_15" id="FNanchor_3_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> that she said this.
(1 song.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

Unidentified.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para10" id="ch03para10"></a>10. She went on. Then she heard someone far downstream.
She thought: "I wonder whether I can jump
four times and reach that place." Then she tried
to find how she could jump. She thought: "I think
I am able to jump. I am light now: I can jump far.
Perhaps if I stand and turn around four, five, six
times I shall go far." She stood there thinking,
thus. Then she turned herself around four times.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
Then she arrived far down below, at Ive&#952;&#299;kwe-'akyulye.
Nyahun&ecirc;m-kway&#257;ve<a name="FNanchor_3_16" id="FNanchor_3_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> lived there. He
said: "The person who has come is not like other
people. He combs and spreads his hair,<a name="FNanchor_3_17" id="FNanchor_3_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> he does
not roll it.<a name="FNanchor_3_18" id="FNanchor_3_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> What is the reason you do not
roll your hair? Come among my people and live
here and I will give you a name." Nyohaiva said:
"It is good. Give me a name. I will join you."
He told her: "Stand facing the south." Then she
faced the south. He sat behind her, looking at
her back. "I give you the name A&#952;'inkume&#948;&#299;,"
he said. When she received that name, Nyohaiva
said: "Now I have a new name. Everyone has heard
it. My name is A&#952;'inkume&#948;&#299;. I have learned something
new." Then she sang. (4 songs.)<a name="FNanchor_3_19" id="FNanchor_3_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

Nyahun&ecirc;m-kway&#257;ve: hune is the Mohave name
of a crook used by the Yavapai for pulling fruit
from the tall sahuaro or giant cactus; it consists
of a pole with a small stick tied at an
angle at the end. Kw-ayave, ayave-k, bent, crooked.</p>

gender in Mohave, so "his" is ambiguous.</p>

It is characteristic that it was at this
point in the story that the interpreter first
realized that Nyohaiva was a woman, not a man.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para11" id="ch03para11"></a>11. From there she went on slowly. She came
near Ama&#7789;-eh&ecirc;'-kwa&#948;&ocirc;ske.<a name="FNanchor_3_20" id="FNanchor_3_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The man who lived
there saw her coming: he was called Hut&#353;at&#353;-mekulypuk.<a name="FNanchor_3_21" id="FNanchor_3_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
He said: "I heard that it was so:
I think this is my sister. I think that I look
like her." When she arrived and stood before
him, he said: "You are my sister."<a name="FNanchor_3_22" id="FNanchor_3_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Nyohaiva
said: "No, you are not my brother."<a name="FNanchor_3_22a" id="FNanchor_3_22a"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_22a" class="fnanchor">[22a]</a> "Yes, you
are my sister," he said. Then she told him:
"Well, let us measure our feet. See, your feet
are different. Let me see your arms. Yours are
different from mine. Mine are short, yours are
long. You are not my brother." Still he insisted:
"Yes, I am your brother." But she said: "No, you
are not like me. You are tall." Then she went
away from that place. (3 songs.)</p>

Evidently a myriapod or centipede. Described
as a white underground insect or worm, longer
than a finger, with legs along both sides of the
body, and able to run fast. "Hut&#353;at&#353;, white-haired;

They use the term hav&#299;kwek, defined by the
narrator as a man or a woman's older or younger
brother or sister, viz., any sibling. The word
has not been secured as kinship term. It is obviously
from hav&#299;k, two; hence probably "one of
a pair."</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para12" id="ch03para12"></a>12. She went to H&ocirc;'aunye-vat&#353;e. Hut&#353;at&#353;-matillaye<a name="FNanchor_3_23" id="FNanchor_3_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
lived there. When she arrived, he
also said to her: "You are my sister." She stood
opposite him, saying: "I do not think I am your
sister." "Yes, you are my sister," he said. Then
she told him: "I have heard of you. You have been
away. No one knew it; no one saw you; but I heard
it: I know you have been away; I know you and what
your name is. You are Hut&#353;at&#353;-matillaye." (3 songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_23" id="Footnote_3_23"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_3_23">[23]</a></span>
Apparently also an insect. It jumps awkwardly,
sometimes falling. For matillaye, compare
ke-layi-m, fall.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para13" id="ch03para13"></a>13. So she went on. When she arrived at a place
where there was no one, she passed by. She reached
Ahmo-kut&#353;e&#952;&#299;lye.<a name="FNanchor_3_24" id="FNanchor_3_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> There she stood on a rock. Then
she heard people singing at Ama&#7789;a-kwit&#353;e. She
thought: "When I come to them they will not know
me. I am afraid they will kill me. How shall I go
there? I do not know." (2 songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

Ahmo' is a mortar.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para14" id="ch03para14"></a>14. She wanted to go to that place. She thought:
"What shall I be? I will become something." Then
she walked, and jumped about. She put three feathers
on herself. Then she became an arrow. She jumped
up.<a name="FNanchor_3_25" id="FNanchor_3_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> She arrived where she had heard the noise,
at Ama&#7789;a-kwit&#353;e, and there she stuck in the ground.
Little boys were playing about and found the arrow.
One of them said: "I have often been here but I
have never seen an arrow sticking in the ground."
He did not take it, but went back and told the old
man who lived in that place. The old man's name
was Halto&#7789;-am&#299;t&#353;-kwis&#257;ma.<a name="FNanchor_3_26" id="FNanchor_3_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> When the boy told him,
this old man said: "Be careful: that is no arrow.
Perhaps it is a person who has become an arrow."
Nyohaiva heard that and thought: "I will change
back. I want to go to that old man's house." Then
she turned human again, and went to the house. The
old man saw her coming and said: "See, she is coming.
I told you that it was no arrow. It is a person
who is coming." When she reached the house,
the old man said: "Give her to eat: give her pumpkins
and corn." They had food ready and gave it to
her. But she did not know that it was food and
would not eat it. She had never eaten that kind before.
They wanted her to eat and said: "Why do you
not eat?" But she said: "No, I do not want to." She
was afraid. She thought: "If I eat it, perhaps it
will kill me."<a name="FNanchor_3_27" id="FNanchor_3_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> She wanted to go on and did not
even sit down. She only squatted and sang. (3 songs.)</p>

K&#299;m-, cf. aky&ecirc;m, shoot; ku-sum&#257;, dream. He dreamed
of bows and arrows and instructed people in successful
hunting, and told how he could shoot the sky and make
his arrows stick in it. He shot at ammo, the mountain
sheep (the three stars of Orion's belt); hence people
hunt mountain sheep. Two or three small stars in a row
in Orion are his arrow.</p>

<a name="ch03para15b" id="ch03para15b"></a>15b. Nyahamo-vetaye had a daughter. He said
to her, as Nyohaiva arrived: "When a traveler
comes, you must talk to her. You must make her
come to the house and be her friend. That is the
way you should do." When the old man said that,
his daughter went to Nyohaiva, took her by the
hand, and brought her to the house. Nyohaiva
would not go in, but sat outside at the corner
of the house. The four men did not know her.
"I wonder who she is," they thought. She was
ashamed and did not look up. She kept her face
down.</p>

<p><a name="ch03para15c" id="ch03para15c"></a>15c. Then K&#299;m-ku-sum&#257;, the youngest of the
four, said: "Do you not know her? Have you not
heard of her? Her name is Nyohaiva. When she
came to one place, she changed her name and took
a new one. I heard that she was coming. Now that
she has come, I can tell from the way she sits,
squatting without sitting down, and from her not
looking at us, that when she goes below where
there are many people, she will stir up trouble
and there will be war and you will not sleep
well."<a name="FNanchor_3_33" id="FNanchor_3_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> He was afraid of her and wanted her to
be killed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

From fear of night or dawn attacks.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para15d" id="ch03para15d"></a>15d. Then Hi&#948;&ocirc;-kwitara, the next oldest brother,
said: "Well, if you will kill her, you must
send word to all, so that they will come and all
our people may know it. Send a man to Halto&#7789;-am&#299;t&#353;-kwis&#257;ma
to tell him that we wish him to
come; that everyone should be here in four days.
I want to roast her alive. I do not want only to
kill her: I want her blood, and her bones to
crush and mix with what we eat. We will do that
on the fourth morning." Nyohaiva heard them say
that; and they, though saying it, nevertheless
gave her to eat; but she would not eat it. She
had heard them say that they would kill her in
four days.</p>

<p><a name="ch03para15e" id="ch03para15e"></a>15e. After two days she went outside and dug
down in the ground. There she found a kneecap.
"That is my father's bone," she said. She dug
on and found a foot bone. "That is my mother's
bone," she said. She dug on and found a rib. Then
she said: "That is my brother's<a name="FNanchor_3_34" id="FNanchor_3_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> bone. The people
here have killed them. I think that they will try
to kill, me in the same way. They recognize me from
my face. They knew me because my face was like my
father's and my mother's and my brother's. How
will they kill me? I would like to know how they
will do. They will make me bet my body against
something that they put up and then they will kill
me. They will bet something against me."</p>

Hav&#299;kwek, of note <a href="#Footnote_3_22">22</a>.&mdash;Finding and playing
with bones of kinsfolk who have been killed by
people that are plotting to kill the hero also,
is a stock episode in Mohave mythology, and a
standard motive for fighting. Cf. the Cane myth.
A game and bet are also a usual preliminary to
war. There is a seeming contradiction in the
fact that Nyohaiva, who grows from the ground
while the earth is still new, should have parents
killed long before. Most Mohave myths, however,
begin with the growth or birth of the hero; and
if fighting later occurs, it is motivated in the
way just explained. Both incidents conform to
the conventional pattern according to which
myths are constructed, so the logical inconsistency
does not jar.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para15f" id="ch03para15f"></a>15f. Then in four days everyone came there.
Nyohaiva had kept under the belt of her skirt the
bones that she had found. Now, taking the foot
bone<a name="FNanchor_3_35" id="FNanchor_3_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> in her hand, she said: "If you can take it
away from me, you can kill me. If you cannot take
it away from me, you shall not kill me. If I am not
able to keep and hold it, you may kill me. I do
not think you will be able to take it away from me,
and if you cannot take it away, I will go off. I
will try to run to Avi-'it&#353;&ocirc;riny&ecirc;ne and there I
will be free. But if you can take it away from me,
and bring it to Kuny&#257;vat&#353;-yampeve, you can have my
bones and blood." Then they prepared to take from
her the ball of bone. But she had dug a little
hole<a name="FNanchor_3_36" id="FNanchor_3_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and there she buried the ball and stood on
it. Then she waved her hands and made it appear
as if she were hiding the bone as she folded her
arms. She said: "If you do not take it away from
me before I come as far south as Avi-'it&#353;&ocirc;riny&ecirc;ne,
I shall win; but if you can get the bone to
Kuny&#257;vat&#353;-yampeve, then I shall lose." Then they
all came toward her. She ran south, holding the
bone between her toes where they did not see it.
They reached her, seized her arms, looked for the
bone in her hands, but could not find it. Again
they pursued her, seized her, held her fast, tore
off all her clothes. She fell, got up again, and
ran on, scratched all over, but they did not find
the bone. Then, when she came to Avi-'it&#353;&ocirc;riny&ecirc;ne,
she threw the bone up, and they all stopped. So
this one woman had beaten those people. "I have
beaten you all. I have dreamed well. In four days
we shall have war," she said, and stretched out
her arm towards them with four fingers extended
(spread in defiance). They stood and looked at her
and thought: "Did I not know it? You cannot overcome
her. She is Nyohaiva. Now we have made trouble
for ourselves. Everything will be turned over."

saying that there would be war in four days. There
was no one there and she was all alone, nevertheless
she told of the war. Then she came to Av&ecirc;-ny-eva.
Two men lived there, Ahma-kunuhwilye and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
T&#353;em-korrave,<a name="FNanchor_3_39" id="FNanchor_3_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> his younger brother. She came to
the house in which they were. She stood at the
door and did not say a word. They did not know
her, so they said: "Who is it?" Then she told
them: "I am A&#952;'inkume&#948;&#299;. I have come to announce
war: I say it will be in four days. That is why
I have come here: I have come to tell you in
how many days there will be war." The two men
said: "I know A&#952;'inkume&#948;&#299;: she is Nyohaiva. I
know her." (1 song.)</p>

Both brothers are green worms or caterpillars
that live in cottonwood trees. They have
a bitter taste. The ordinary name of Ahma-kunuhwilye
is hamasukwenpa. A similar black worm
is called ami&#952;e. Ahma, quail, is also a small
bitter melon, not good to eat; ku-nuhwilye is to
drag. Korrave, or kw-irrave, means pain. T&#353;em-korrave
was thinking of his food, huk&#952;ara-nyamely-a'uva,
coyote's-food-tobacco, a strong,
pungent, wild tobacco.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para18" id="ch03para18"></a>18. Then she went on and came to a place to
which she gave the name Qapotaq-iv'auve. She
stood there and said: "I can tell where I am:
I have dreamed well." Now she was there alone,
but she said: "I say we shall have war." Then
she tried what she could do. She trotted, to the
south one step (<i>sic</i>). Then she came back. Then
she trotted one step to the west and returned,
then one to the north, then one to the east.<a name="FNanchor_3_40" id="FNanchor_3_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Then she pulled out one hair on her right side
and threw it to the west, and it began to rain.
She said: "I thought I should do that. I dreamed
about war: that is my power; I know that." (4
songs, one about each direction.)</p>

Avi-tuva'auve. There she stood and said: "I
thought the sky was far off. I thought the
earth, too, was far around, and that its end
could not be told. But now, when I have arrived
here, the sky is not far away, and the (end of
the) earth is near." Thus she thought. (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch03para20" id="ch03para20"></a>20. She went on again and came to Ak'ulye-t&#353;akap&#257;va,
a high hill, on which she stood. From
there she heard and saw many men. She said:
"They have been away a long time. I heard of
that; I see it now. They are ready to make war.
I see them prepared with feathers, with bows
and arrows and war clubs, and with paint, ready
to fight." (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch03para21" id="ch03para21"></a>21. From there she went on, running. When
she had gone part of the way to where she had
seen the people, she came to a rock. She stood
on this. This rock had no name. She said: "I
give it a name. I call it Avi-t&#353;it&#353;e." From
there she again saw the people all ready for
war. "I am glad," she said, as she saw them
playing and wearing feathers and carrying bows
and clubs. (4 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch03para22" id="ch03para22"></a>22. She went on down along the river again.
Four times she ran and rested. Then she began
to be near the place. Now she had long hair<a name="FNanchor_3_41" id="FNanchor_3_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
and wore a dress of willow bark.<a name="FNanchor_3_42" id="FNanchor_3_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Then she
thought: "How shall I approach them?" Then she
took some of the strands of her dress from one
side and the other and tied them across the front
like a belt. She did not tie her hair, but grasped
it on both sides and twisted the two masses into
a knot behind.<a name="FNanchor_3_43" id="FNanchor_3_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> "And I want to do something to
look pretty," she said. She took a handful of dirt
and rubbed it across her jaw and her forehead.
"That will not do: it will not show," she said.
Putting her hands down to the ground once more,
she dug. Then she reached into the hole and took
out white earth paint. From a handful she made
four horizontal stripes across her face. These
were white and plain. "That is better. Now I look
well. And I will give a name to this place. I will
call it Ama&#7789;-eh&ecirc;'-i&#948;auve.<a name="FNanchor_3_44" id="FNanchor_3_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Now it has a name."

twice and rested. Then she arrived where those
people were. She did not go in among them, but
stood off at a little distance. She saw that they
were prepared and ready for war, with feathers and
bows and clubs and all weapons. Then Hivilyk-kemohakwe,<a name="FNanchor_3_45" id="FNanchor_3_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
a man who was there, called to her,
"Come!" She came nearer but soon stood still.
"Come!" he called again. Again she came but stopped.
"Come!" he said once more, and again she came but
stood. Again he said, "Come!" This time she came
in among the crowd. She still held white paint in
her hand. When the people saw this, they all took
some from her, put it into their own hands, spat
on them, rubbed them together to make them white,
then drew their finger-tips over their palms, and
with their fingers painted white marks on their
hair. They said: "We will fight. We want to prepare
because we will fight." They all did that. Then
Nyohaiva said to them: "It is well. But wait: I
will think about it. I will tell you how to go,
how to arrive, how to fight. Now I want to give a
name to this place so that all will know from where
we started to go to war. The name of this place is
Ava-t&#353;ohai.<a name="FNanchor_3_46" id="FNanchor_3_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Now all will know it." (4 songs.)</p>

on. Let us go at once." Then they went north
along the west side of the river. They continued
to go on to Ama&#7789;-tato'it&#353;e. Then she said: "Let
us rest: all sit in the shade." Now Hivilyk-kemohakwe
went off from them up on the mesa to
see if there was anyone to fight. As he looked
north to see if there were smoke or dust, he
stepped on an ata&#7789;a (Mamillaria) cactus. The
thorns entered his foot, hurt, and he was unable
to walk. He returned crawling on his knees. Then
Nyohaiva said; "See, we have bad luck. If we had
good luck, the thorn would not have entered you:
now your luck is bad." Then she drew out all the
thorns. "Now you are well again: you will walk.
Let me see you!" He tried to walk but could not
yet. Then she spoke and sang once more, and now
he had no pain and could walk again. "Let us go
on," she said. (2 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch03para27" id="ch03para27"></a>27. They went northward. When they came to
Aqw&#257;qa-m&#363;ny&ocirc;, they saw dust and smoke and heard
noise. Nyohaiva said: "That is near the place.
That is near my father's and mother's and brother's
bones. I came by there. I know they are
there, those whom we go to fight. Now all do as
I want you to. I wish all tribes to fight. If I
did not fight, no one in future would fight."
She thought of what she was about to do, and how
pleasant it would be, and that they were all to
learn how to make the war dance. (3 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch03para28" id="ch03para28"></a>28. They started on again. Now they were near,
at Matha-t&#353;e-kwilyeve,<a name="FNanchor_3_52" id="FNanchor_3_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and stopped. There were
hills there and a wash and a little mesa. Someone
was standing on the mesa. He ran down toward
them. Nyohaiva saw him coming and said: "I think
they are sending a message to us. They are sending
someone as a spy. Or perhaps he is coming to
meet me, to tell me that there will be war. I
see him: he is coming." Now that person came
among the crowd. He was not afraid. Nyohaiva saw
him and said: "Oh, you are my brother."<a name="FNanchor_3_53" id="FNanchor_3_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Then
he said: "There where you see the smoke and hear

'He is going to become something,' they said of
me." His body was a person's, but he had horns.

<p><a name="ch03para29" id="ch03para29"></a>29. Then they went on again until they came to
Ko&#952;&icirc;lye. There A&#952;'inkume&#948;&#299; (Nyohaiva) entered
the river up to her knees. The water rushing about
her legs made a noise and frightened her. She said:
"I will tell of this water. Then the river will not
run fast. It will flow slowly. I will make it be
like that, not as it is now." So she told<a name="FNanchor_3_56" id="FNanchor_3_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> about
the river. When she had sung three times, the
river flowed smoothly and they crossed to the eastern
side once more. (3 songs.)</p>

Sang?</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para30" id="ch03para30"></a>30. Now when they had arrived on that side, all
took up their feathers and paint, and Nyohaiva
said: "Put on your feathers and paint. Paint yourselves
black, but your hair red. I will tell you
what to do. I will sing about you." (4 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch03para31" id="ch03para31"></a>31. Then, when all were dressed, they went on.
They went without stopping, and as they walked
Nyohaiva continued to talk. The four leaders<a name="FNanchor_3_57" id="FNanchor_3_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
went ahead; the others were behind. Nyohaiva said:
"I will reach them first. I will begin the fight."
As she walked she sang about their steps, and as
their arms swung she sang of those. For a little
distance she sang thus. (5 songs.)</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_57" id="Footnote_3_57"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_3_57">[57]</a></span>
Nyohaiva and the three blackbirds.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch03para32" id="ch03para32"></a>32. Now they were near, and all of them ready,
painted and wearing feathers and holding their
clubs. Then Nyohaiva said: "I dreamed well: no one
can surpass me." She wanted to do something. She
spat on her hand, rubbed her hands together to
make a ball magically, and threw it towards the
people at Aqw&#257;qa-have. "That will make them sleep,"
she said. What she threw entered Nyaham&ocirc;-vetaye's
house and hit a post. It was nearly sundown and
Nyaham&ocirc;-vetaye's people were still outdoors; but
now they all came in; everyone went in. Nyohaiva
said: "See, they are all entering. We shall overcome
them. They can do nothing against us. I am
able to make them all go into the house. You will
see that they all sleep. Now we four will go in:
the rest of you stay here." Then the four leaders
went on and entered the house. They were looking
for one man. In the dark Nyohaiva put her hand
on the legs and faces of the sleepers in order to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
find him. As she touched them she made them weak
and sleepy. Then she found the man in the middle
of the house. She put her hand on his body and
on his ear and knew him because he lacked one
ear. His hair was long and he had it coiled in a
large bunch, on which his head was resting.<a name="FNanchor_3_58" id="FNanchor_3_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
Nyohaiva said: "This is he for whom I was looking:
this is Ot&#353;&ocirc;uta, who wanted to kill me.<a name="FNanchor_3_59" id="FNanchor_3_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Now I
have found him and will kill him." Then the four
carried him outside. Nyohaiva said to him: "I
will take your head from you alive. I will tell
you about it before I kill you." As Ot&#353;&ocirc;uta sat
there,<a name="FNanchor_3_60" id="FNanchor_3_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> she seized his hair and pulled it. Four
times she moved him as she pulled it. The fourth
time she said: "Now I will behead you. I have no
knife, but I can kill you with my thumbnail."
Then she felt about his neck. She knew where the
bones joined: there she cut him with her thumbnail.
She cut entirely around his neck, cut off
his head, and held it up. The body lay there,
jumped up, walked, fell down, jumped again, fell,
and died only after a time. Then Nyohaiva said:
"Now we will tell about this head."<a name="FNanchor_3_61" id="FNanchor_3_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> (4 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch03para33" id="ch03para33"></a>33. Then she said to her people: "Let us go
northward on this side of the river. I have
heard that people live here; but we will not go
near them. They want war with us, but we will
not stay." So they went. They came to Aha-&#948;ekup&#299;&#948;a.<a name="FNanchor_3_62" id="FNanchor_3_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
They went on past that place, on up
the river until they came to Sama'&ocirc;kusa. Many
people lived there. There were four men<a name="FNanchor_3_63" id="FNanchor_3_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> there,
Alyha'-tuy&#257;me, Alyha'-tokw&#299;me, Alyha'-t&#353;a&ocirc;re,

see the head that she brought, but Nyohaiva said:
"No, I will not show it to you now. I will let
you see it, but not now. You will see it in time."
She hid the head under her dress. She would not
show it to them. She said: "When I show it and
you sing, all will know what to do with it."
Then she marked a ring on the ground. She stood
in the center and waved her hand to the people
to come. "Come, all of you, and see this head,"
she said. All came and stood about. Then she
threw the head up so that it fell on the ground:
she threw it up four times. Then she said: "Now
you have seen the head: you all know it. Now we
will sing about it." Then she sang about its bones,
its eyes, its eyelashes, its tongue, its mouth,
its teeth, and its nose. (4 songs.)</p>

you will do the same. But there is another thing."
She made four heaps of sand. Then she ran to the
south, returned, and with her right foot stirred
in one of the heaps. She ran east and returned and
stirred in another heap; then north, and stirred
in another heap; then west, and stirred in the
fourth.<a name="FNanchor_3_65" id="FNanchor_3_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> As she stirred that one, she took out
from it<a name="FNanchor_3_66" id="FNanchor_3_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> a sandbar-willow (ihore) stick, a long

head so that it waved.<a name="FNanchor_3_67" id="FNanchor_3_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> "That is how I do," she

"When there is war and a scalp is taken, people
will do as I have done. They will dance and enjoy
themselves. All will be happy and will play and
sing. I have done that. Now I wonder what I shall
be. I wonder where I shall go." As she thought,
she was holding the skull of the head in her hand.
She went eastward two steps and stood there. "The
name of this place is Ama&#7789;-ya'&#257;ma,"<a name="FNanchor_3_68" id="FNanchor_3_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> she said.
Then, standing there, she threw Ot&#353;&ocirc;uta's skull
far south, nearly to Yuma. "I want it to become a
rock," she said. Then it became the rock called
Avi-melyeky&ecirc;te.<a name="FNanchor_3_69" id="FNanchor_3_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

about her. She was thinking about her own body.
"I wonder what color I shall be: white or blue or
yellow? Well, I will turn black. I shall be a rock,
but all will know me, that I am Nyohaiva. My name
will be Avi-soqw&#299;lye.<a name="FNanchor_3_70" id="FNanchor_3_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> All will know that rock and

soqw&#299;lye hawks nest. It is about a quarter of a
mile from Ama&#7789;-ya'&#257;ma. The transformation is appropriate
for the leading character of a war cycle,
because dreaming of soqw&#299;lye hawks is what makes
warriors.</p>

<h3><a name="chap03s3" id="chap03s3"></a>THE SONG SCHEME</h3>

<p>As already said, the Nyohaiva singing is
"short": it requires only one night to complete,
probably including a certain amount of narration.</p>

<p>I give the number of songs at each point,
first as the narrator volunteered them in telling
the full text, and next as he subsequently revised
them in a review of the skeleton of the
story. There are the usual discrepancies; some
perhaps due to misunderstanding; more, probably,
to his not having in mind any really fixed
scheme of the number of songs at each place.</p>

<p>The first list aggregates 110 songs in 34
groups; the second, 98 or 100 in 33. In the first
list, groups of four songs are most frequent, occurring
17 times. In the second list groups of
four occur only 10 times, but groups of three 16
times. In short, in the second enumeration the
typical group consists of three instead of four
songs. At what appear to be crucial points&mdash;Nyohaiva's
identity, her new name, the contest,
Ot&#353;&ocirc;uta's killing, the scalp dance&mdash;the two lists
agree in naming the full complement of four songs.
Evidently there is some sense that lesser episodes
merit fewer songs. That this sense of relative
weight is fairly constant is shown by the fact
that of 31 places or stages to which both lists
attribute songs, 19 have the same number; 9 differ
by only one song, as three for four or three for
two; and only 3 differ more widely: see paragraphs
<a href="#ch03para7">7</a>, <a href="#ch03para25">25</a>, <a href="#ch03para31">31</a>. There is thus evident a plan in the
narrator's mind for relative elaboration of songs
in different parts of the story. This plan is adhered
to with approximate consistency or repetition;
but it is no precise ritual scheme fixed in
memory.</p>

<p>As usual, the song scheme serves also as a
synopsis of the narrative. I have therefore organized
it by introducing captions. It is evident
from this outline that only about three of the
thirty-odd sections contain vigorous plot such as
is the usual content of myths and tales in cultures
of the same general level as the Mohave. These are
sections <a href="#ch03para14">14</a> and especially <a href="#ch03para15a">15</a> and <a href="#ch03para32">32</a>. If to these
are added the first and last one or two brief sections,
to give the heroine an origin and an end,
we have about the equivalent of what most American
tribes would use to make a tale. The remaining
sections, nearly thirty, are Mohave filling, or
prolixity, dispensable incidents which make the
story run slower but give opportunity to build up
the singing into a long series, a real cycle,
corresponding to a ritual among other tribes. This
song association is presumably the cause of the
dilatory narration; though it is also clear that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
the Mohave like the strung-along episodes for
their own sake, and maintain the habit even when
the narrative is unaccompanied by songs, as in
the Mastamho myth and Great Tale.</p>

<p>The difference in manner, according as interest
in plot or in song themes prevails, is shown
by the fact that the three paragraphs mentioned
(<a href="#ch03para14">14</a>, <a href="#ch03para15a">15</a>, <a href="#ch03para32">32</a>) take up about three-tenths of the
length of the narrative, but have only one-tenth
of the songs referring to them. That is, Mohave
singing is far from really dramatic. Its text
tends to be pensive, subjective, reflective on
incidents. When the action becomes eventful,
tense, or critical, the songs become few, or
drop out, until the flow of the narrative quiets
again.</p>

<p>From one to four of the songs of each of the
groups were phonographically recorded in cylinders
catalogued as 14-228 to 14-269 in the University
of California Museum of Anthropology.
The correspondence of these phonograms to the
sections of the narrative is as follows:</p>

<h2><a name="chap04" id="chap04"></a>IV. RAVEN</h2>


<p>This song-myth was recorded near Needles on
March 19, 1903, from Pamit&#353;, "Weeping Person,"
a middle-aged man of the Sun-fire-deer-eagle clan,
who call their daughters Nyo'ilt&#353;a (or Ny&ocirc;rt&#353;a
after they have lost a child). Jack Jones interpreted.
The story has been previously outlined
and discussed in Handbook of the California Indians,
page 761, and some songs given on page 758.
It was there characterized as "a curious tale
within a tale, if it can be called a story at all.
The [boy] heroes do nothing but move thirty feet,
sing all night, and disappear [as ravens] at daybreak.
What they sing of is what any Mohave would
be likely to sing of if he sat up. The story is
thus but a pallid reflection of the conventional
subjects of Mohave singing." This judgment is
confirmed by the outline of songs given below.</p>

<p>While Raven is said by the Mohave to be sung
at celebrations and to refer to war, along with
Tumanpa, Vinimulye, and Nyohaiva, it differs
from the last two of these&mdash;which have just been
given&mdash;in that these contain actual narratives
of fighting as the central theme of the plot;
whereas Raven merely sings of war customs in the
abstract. There is also no travel in Raven, except
mental travel. Tumanpa is like Raven in that
it has no war story; like Vinimulye and Nyohaiva
in that there is journeying; and is peculiar&mdash;especially
for a war and festival song-cycle&mdash;in
that its formal theme is incest.</p>


<h3><a name="chap04s1" id="chap04s1"></a>NARRATOR'S STATEMENTS</h3>

<p>Pamit&#353; said to me: "I was a baby boy [meaning
a foetus&mdash;see below] when I dreamed this singing:
it was given me by the Ravens. Now I am a man, but
have not forgotten it. I dreamed it before I ever
was born. If I had been born when I dreamed it, I
would have forgotten it. No, I did not learn it
from other Mohaves; and I did not hear any of them
sing it. In fact, no one else sings like this, for
it was I that dreamed it myself." Later he added:
"Only I and Jo Nelson" (the narrator of the Mastamho
Myth, VII, below) "know this Raven, and he learned
it from me; he did not dream it. Jo is my paternal
cousin, it&#353;k&#257;k" (a term not recorded otherwise).
"If one of us two dies, the other will sing Raven
for him all of a day and a night. My older brother,
and his son, also learned it from me. And my
grown-up daughter learned it, without dreaming: I
will sing it for her if she dies, or she for me."</p>

<p>He added: "When a raven is on the ground, he
hops twice before rising in flight. That is why
I shake my gourd rattle downward twice before
raising it to sing; and why the women who are to
dance hop twice before I start my song. Then,
when I shake it upward, they just walk past me;
until, a few beats before the end of the song
(8 or 10 bars), I make a long downward sweep of
the rattle, nearly to the ground. This is the
signal for the women to begin to dance. When we
do like this, in the daytime, it is outdoors, and I
walk slowly back and forth, and the women dance forward
and backward, following me. When I sing indoors,
there is no dancing, and I stay seated in one place
near the middle of the house all night, except sometimes
I rise to my knees."</p>

<p>I did not see an actual Raven dance, but it was
illustrated for me as follows. The women bend their
knees somewhat so that their skirt hem is lowered
perhaps four or five inches. They then sag and rise
in the knee an inch or two, without moving their
feet or even rising on their toes. The body is inclined
slightly forward, the head is erect, the eyes
wide open and looking level (not lowered as by Plains
Indian women); the arms hang straight down, almost
stiffly, the wrists perhaps being bent back a trifle.
When the women move forward and back, they shuffle
their feet forward (or back) an inch or two at each
step, without raising them from the ground.</p>

<h3><a name="chap04s3" id="chap04s3"></a>THE RAVEN STORY</h3>

<p><a name="ch04para1" id="ch04para1"></a>1. It was at Ha'avulypo that Matavilya built
the first house.<a name="FNanchor_4_1" id="FNanchor_4_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> After he died, two brothers,
Aq&#257;qa, the Ravens, were there. When such birds
find anything that has died, they eat it; but
they would not have eaten Matavilya then, even
if they had seen him. But they did not see him,
for these two, the older and the younger brother,
only grew from the ground where the northwest
corner of the house had been, after this house
had been burned down.<a name="FNanchor_4_2" id="FNanchor_4_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The name of the older
brother was Humar-kwi&#948;e, of the younger, Humar-hanga.<a name="FNanchor_4_3" id="FNanchor_4_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
They were little boys then&mdash;not Ravens.
They looked up to the sky, and all about, and
saw that the world had been made. Then they
looked toward the south. As they sat, they each
sang two songs; first the older, then the younger.
(4 songs.)<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

Humar is boy; the sound ng does not occur in
Mohave speech, but is frequent in the distorted
forms which words assume when sung. Hang is also
the Mohave idea of the reverberating sound produced
by beating or scraping a basket set in
front of the mouth of a jar&mdash;the proper accompaniment
to certain song-series.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_4_4">[4]</a></span>
The first song of the four is: hum&#299;k pi'ipaik
nakwi&#948;auk, now-both being-alive we-sit-here.</p>

<p><a name="ch04para2" id="ch04para2"></a>2. Then they said to each other: "My brother,
we will leave this place. We grew here. We came
out of the corner here, but now we will leave
it." So they started from their corner, crawling

Then they began to talk of cane-buzzers<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which
they had. There was no cane there then. Nevertheless
they had cane, both ahta-hamaka and ahta-hat&#353;ima,
large cane and small cane. They said:
"I hear canes swaying in the wind in the west
and in the south." They heard it rustling. That
is why large cane grows in the south below Yuma,
and in the west; but not in this country. They
sang twice each. (4 songs.)</p>

They said: "We have no gourds. That will
not do. When people make war and kill an enemy

things." Now they were about to make a gourd to
give to me.<a name="FNanchor_4_9" id="FNanchor_4_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> They said: "We have none yet but we

south.<a name="FNanchor_4_10" id="FNanchor_4_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Then he had a gourd in his right hand.

It is he." The youngest did not know that. The older

Then he sang six times and his younger brother
sang six times. (12 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch04para7" id="ch04para7"></a>7. Now the older said again: "There is another

We know more than they. We have dreamed well and
are brave and can beat them." He meant that no
tribe could overcome the Mohave in war. They each
sang two songs about this. (4 songs.)</p>

the place where they had sat, near the back corner
of the house, to near the door. Then the elder
said: "My younger brother, we will tell of our
body: of our legs, our arms, our head, our nose.
We will tell of every part of our bodies before
we go outdoors." (4 songs.)</p>

<p><a name="ch04para27" id="ch04para27"></a>27. Then they both stood up. Now they were able
to walk: they were young men. They said: "We have
told all we know. It is enough. Anyone who dreams
of us and sees us, will know everything, and will
be able to tell all that we have said. We have not
seen what we tell of, nevertheless we know all
these things." (4 songs.)</p>

Shall our bodies be black, or yellow, or red? How
will it be?" (4 songs.)</p>

Counterclockwise, starting in the east: cf.
note <a href="#Footnote_4_10">10</a>; also <a href="#appendix01">Appendix I</a>. The Mohave frequently
mention cardinal circuits and sometimes associate
colors with the points, but without any fixed
direction of the circuit or fixed color association.

set. The fact and content of dreaming are more
important to them than precisely formulated ritual

not yet go far. They rose only as high as a
house. Four times they tried, but said: "No,
we cannot yet fly." (4 songs.)</p>

younger on the west, both facing the south. It

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05"></a>V. DEER</h2>


<h3><a name="chap05s1" id="chap05s1"></a>DISCUSSION</h3>

<p>This tale of Aqw&#257;q-siv&#257;re or Deer-singing was
recorded at Needles, on March 21, 1903, from
Yellow-thigh, known also as Enter-fire and Three-horses,
a man of one of the Tobacco clans, who
call their daughters Ka&#7789;a. Yellow-thigh did not
profess to have dreamed this song-myth-cycle: he
said he had learned it from his older relatives.
His son also knew it.</p>

<p>The beginning and end of the story, comprising
about a quarter of its length, deal with two
great felines, Jaguar and Mountain Lion. At least,
that is who they are here construed as being:
certain doubts of identification will be discussed
in a moment. These two create for themselves a
pair of Deer, who travel eastward for two nights
and on the second day of their journey are ambushed
by the cats who have gone ahead to lie in
wait for them in the Walapai country, in order
that the Walapai may learn hunting. Three-fourths
of the story relate to the wanderings of the
Deer, and all the songs of the cycle except the
very last set are sung by them. The listener's
emotional identification is thus with the Deer,
rather than with their creators and destroyers;
as the cycle name would also indicate. The result
is that most of the tale is pervaded by a flavor
of doom, such as the Mohave manage to inject,
however inarticulately, into many of their mythical
narratives.</p>

<p>The geography&mdash;after formal respects are paid
to the beginning of things at Ha'avulypo&mdash;is
simple: a west-to-east journey from Gabrielino
or Serrano country near the sea in California to
Walapai territory in upland Arizona. This includes
something of a swerve first north and then south
to take in Avikwame and the upper part of Mohave
valley.</p>

<p>Biologically, the Jaguar has his regular northern
limits in Sinaloa or southern Sonora. Occasional
strays however roamed into Arizona and
perhaps southern California. He was certainly a
traditional animal to most Mohave: very few of
them could ever have seen one, even in the old
days; but he was not imaginary. There is some
confusion as to which name designates which feline,
or whether one of them may not in fact be Wolf.
I have translated Numeta as Jaguar, and Hatekulye
as Mountain Lion (Puma), because Nume is Wildcat,
and the Jaguar is spotted dark on yellow like
that smaller stub-tailed animal.<a name="FNanchor_5_1" id="FNanchor_5_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Hatekulye was
said by the Mohave to refer to a long tail, a
feature which many Indian tribes note about Mountain
Lion. Etymologically, the word seems to mean
"long dog"; which would of course be Wolf. In
that event, nume-ta, the "real cat" or "large cat,"
would presumably be the commoner Mountain Lion,
and Jaguar would not enter into the present story.
The wobbliness of identification by the Mohave
and other Yumans is increased by the fact that
two other large carnivores besides the jaguar,
the wolf and the bear, are not regular habitants
of their lands.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_5_1" id="Footnote_5_1"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_5_1">[1]</a></span>
These are the vocabulary data: In all Yuman
dialects, nume', or some obvious dialectic variant,
means wildcat. In Walapai (F. Kniffen et al.,
Walapai Ethnography, AAA-M 42, 1935) nyimi-ta was
given as mountain lion (p. 64), and hat-<sup>a</sup>kwil<sup>a</sup> as
wolf, described by some, however, as blunt-nosed
like a cat, and perhaps confused with straggling
jaguars; it also was a rare animal. In Yuma, I
was given xat-ak&#363;ly for mountain lion (&#322;aqol-k
meaning long), to which &#299;mt&#353;a xant&#353;-eku&#322; was said
to be the Cocopa equivalent. I secured no words
for jaguar or wolf. In Maricopa my forms ran:
name', wildcat; nam&middot;e-t or nam&middot;et xat-ekyulyk,
mountain lion; xat-<sup>e</sup>kwily(k) or xat-<sup>e</sup>kuly, wolf.
Spier, Comparative Vocabularies (Univ. N. Mex.
Publ. Anthr. no. 2, 1946, pp. 104 seq.) gives
these Maricopa forms: name-s, wildcat; name-t,
cougar (viz., mountain lion); name-t hatagult,
"cougar wolf"; name-t katca-s, jaguar; xatagult,
xatagul<sup>ya</sup>, wolf,&nbsp;? from xatagwilg, "bigger than
a dog" (xat). In the same place he gives the
Havasupai forms as nyim'i, wildcat; nyimita,
mountain lion; hatagwila, wolf; no form for jaguar.
The weight of this comparative evidence
would seem to make the heroes of the present
Mohave tale Mountain Lion and Wolf rather than
Jaguar and Mountain Lion. But what is perhaps
surest is that two of these three carnivores did
not occur regularly in Mohave territory, and Mountain
Lion was probably uncommon, so that a degree
of uncertainty prevailed as to the identity of
all of them.</p>
</div>

<p>The amount of discursive detail in this version
is moderate. The number of songs in the
series is around 90. No two statements by the
narrator, as to how many he sang at each point,
agree altogether; as is customary for the Mohave.
But the subjoined table shows that a scheme is
adhered to. The narrator probably intends singing
about 4, or 7, or 1, or 3, or 8 songs on a given
episode, and perhaps approximately remembers sets
of words for each song in a group. The blanks in
the first column of the table presumably mean
only that the teller had not yet got started in
mentioning songs. If we supply the omissions from
the next column, the addition of these 23 makes
the total 90, as compared with totals of 90 and
88 in other listings.</p>

<h3><a name="chap05s3" id="chap05s3"></a>WORDS OF SONGS</h3>

<p>The following are the words of some songs:</p>

<p><a name="ch05s3para1" id="ch05s3para1"></a>1. The very first song of the cycle, where
the Deer are made at Dark-mountain far in the
west (par. <a href="#ch05s4para5">5</a>). Deer sings: inyahavek tinyamk
kanavek, west it-is-night, tell.</p>

<p><a name="ch05s3para2" id="ch05s3para2"></a>2. First song at Hoalye-ketekururve (par. <a href="#ch05s4para25">25</a>),
next to the last step in the journey, and the
last at which the Deer sing. Hatekulye kanavek,
Mountain-Lion tell-(of).</p>

<p><a name="ch05s3para3" id="ch05s3para3"></a>3. Same place, second song. Ipa amaimiyak
kanavek, Arrow from-above tell.</p>

<p><a name="ch05s3para4" id="ch05s3para4"></a>4. Same, third song. Ipui-mo&#7789;e' ipa'-maimiate
ninyupakem hirra'a-m&ocirc;&#7789;(e), I-shall-not-die-arrow-from-above
fall-on-me it-does-not-pain.</p>

<p><a name="ch05s3para5" id="ch05s3para5"></a>5. Same, fourth song, last by the Deer. Ito-nye-kyam
ipa'-maimiak, Belly-in-shoot arrow-from-above.</p>

<p><a name="ch05s3para6" id="ch05s3para6"></a>6. Apparently Jaguar sings, at Land-blood-have:
Himekeseik kwora'&#257;k-o&ecirc;ve, Track-them old-man
(= brother).</p>

<p><a name="ch05s3para7" id="ch05s3para7"></a>7. The same: Intomaku-mo&#7789;e itavere(m)
view&ecirc;me&#952;(a), Do-not-desist chasing continue.</p>

<p><a name="ch05s3para8" id="ch05s3para8"></a>8. The same: Hatapui viu&ecirc;mhe kwora&#257;k-o&ecirc;ve,
Kill-them continue brother.</p>

<p><a name="ch05s3para9" id="ch05s3para9"></a>9. The final song of the cycle, still by Jaguar:
Kwora'&#257;k-o&ecirc;vit&#353; at&#353;wo&#948;avek hima&#7789;va hikw&#299;ve t&#353;a&#952;wilve
kosmave, Brother divide-it flesh horns hide sinew.</p>


<h3><a name="chap05s4" id="chap05s4"></a>THE DEER STORY</h3>

<p><a name="ch05s4para1" id="ch05s4para1"></a>1. When Matavilya died and Mastamho took his
place<a name="FNanchor_5_2" id="FNanchor_5_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he gave supernatural power to Jaguar and
Mountain Lion,<a name="FNanchor_5_3" id="FNanchor_5_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> two brothers. No one saw them while
they dug a hole into the ground and disappeared.
They traveled underground toward the wind.<a name="FNanchor_5_4" id="FNanchor_5_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> At
Hatekulye-naka,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> above Avi-kwatulye,<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> they emerged.
Here they raised themselves out of the ground as
far as their breasts, turning their heads to look
around. Seeing only mountains all about, they said:
"This is no place for us," and went underneath again.</p>

until they came to Avi-kwin-yehore, Avi-ku-tinyam,
Kwilykikipa, and Kwamalyukikwa.<a name="FNanchor_5_7" id="FNanchor_5_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> There Jaguar proceeded
to make Deer. He put his hand into the ground:
but the earth was not good. Then he thrust his hand
farther down until he found good clay. Then, just as
little girls have clay dolls, he made a Deer, with
legs and neck and horns and all parts. He made a Doe
also. So the two Deer came into existence.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5_7" id="Footnote_5_7"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_5_7">[7]</a></span>
West of San Bernardino, California; that is,
in Serrano or Gabrielino territory. The second
name means "dark mountain."</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch05s4para3" id="ch05s4para3"></a>3. Now it was dark where Jaguar and Mountain Lion
were.<a name="FNanchor_5_8" id="FNanchor_5_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Then they said: "There are flint arrow-points.<a name="FNanchor_5_9" id="FNanchor_5_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Some persons will dream of those. Then they will make
them; they will make bows also." Then they measured
a bow. They measured it a fathom in length. It was
too long. So they measured it somewhat shorter, and
said: "That is good: it will be right for the Walapai
and Yavapai." They prepared sinews and feathers for
the arrows. When they had finished everything else,
they said: "Rattlesnake, scorpion, black-widow spider,<a name="FNanchor_5_10" id="FNanchor_5_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and tarantula<a name="FNanchor_5_11" id="FNanchor_5_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> are the poisons to use. We will tell
the Walapai and the Yavapai about them. They will
take these four poisons, mix them with a plant and
with red paint. They will paint their arrow-points
with that and their bows and arrows too. Then if
they pursue game, it will not be able to run fast."<a name="FNanchor_5_12" id="FNanchor_5_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

The Mohave say that the Walapai who have
dreamed of Jaguar and Mountain Lion follow this
practice. If anyone but the owner takes hold of
the bow, his hand swells. They also tie to their
moccasins a small piece of deerskin containing
this poison. Among the Mohave, on the other hand,
certain men, who wish to be lucky in gambling,
tie to their hair a small concealed bag of rattlesnake
teeth and paint. This is, however, likely
to render them cripples.</p>

<a name="ch05s4para4" id="ch05s4para4"></a>4. Now Jaguar and Mountain Lion took the two
Deer that they had made and said: "They are finished.
We will make wind blow on their bodies
and cause it to rain over them. The rain will
wash out all bad smell and make their flesh
good." They made it blow and rain on the Deer
and said: "Now that we have made wind and rain,
all their bad smell has disappeared. Their meat
is good. And now they will be able to go anywhere
and never become cold."</p>

<p><a name="ch05s4para5" id="ch05s4para5"></a>5. The two Deer stood looking westward. Then
they faced south, east, and north.<a name="FNanchor_5_13" id="FNanchor_5_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> They wanted
to know the land, and where the sun and the night
came from. Now they knew that, for the male was
wise. He said: "There is the sun. It is going
down." But the female said: "No, the wind and the
clouds are taking it away. And there is no place
for it to go to; perhaps there are only mountains,
perhaps only sea there. Perhaps it will
go behind the mountains, or descend into the fog
at the sea." Then they both looked toward the
east, and the male said: "Here darkness is coming.
When it comes it will bring the stars and
the moon in the sky. Then we will know which way
to go east." (4 songs.)</p>

Anti-clockwise circuit, starting in the west.</p>

<p><a name="ch05s4para6" id="ch05s4para6"></a>6. Now the two deer started eastward. They
came to Hoalye-ke&#948;sokyave.<a name="FNanchor_5_14" id="FNanchor_5_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Jaguar and Mountain
Lion had given them good eyes: They could see
well. Now they said: "Everything is finished,
but it is dark. Do you hear a noise? When it is
dark there is always a noise. Every one sleeps
except two, Tinyam-hwarehware<a name="FNanchor_5_15" id="FNanchor_5_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and Tona&#952;aqwataye.<a name="FNanchor_5_16" id="FNanchor_5_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>

said: "This is what they have given us: I know

they called it Avi-wa&#952;a; it is not far away." They

said: "Now I will tell about my body: of my legs,
my tail, my ears, my horns, and everything. Sometimes
my horns change: they itch, and I rub them
against rocks or trees. Then I grow new horns and

Now there were bushes there, a huelye bush to

at Avikwame and go elsewhere." (14 songs.)</p>

They saw ten or twelve of them. There were only
the two Deer. The Antelope stood at a distance

"Someone is coming," they said. They saw them
carrying rats and rabbits in their belts and fastened
to a string around their shoulders. When
they came near, they saw that they had their tails
drawn between their legs because they were afraid.
The Deer said: "I know you: you are Wildcats; you
hunt. When you kill rats and rabbits, you eat them
raw; you do not cook them." Then the Wildcats went
into the brush without looking at them. (2 songs.)</p>

stood at the foot of the mesa below these places.
Jaguar and Mountain Lion caused them to stop there.
The male said: "This night is bad; it is not an
ordinary night." But the female said: "Yes, it is
usual; you will see. It is dark, and the stars are

jaws on the gravel. Jaguar saw that; he saw them
lying there, though he was far in the west. Now
the male heard what (Jaguar) said and got up. He
said: "It is a bad night; I have dreamed bad. I
think I shall not live long." Waking the female,
he said: "I will tell you what I have dreamed: I
dreamed bad. I know what will happen. There are
four mountains which Numeta and Hatekulye named.

stood; then went upward, onto the mesa. There

tracks. They are the tracks of Yellow Jaguar and
Yellow Mountain Lion.<a name="FNanchor_5_47" id="FNanchor_5_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> It is they. They traveled
here by the wind and by the clouds. We cannot see
them, but they are above us in the canyon or
perhaps in the mountain and they can see us."
The female said: "You see tracks, but they are
not new. They have been there a long time; they
were here when the earth was made." The male
said: "No, they have been here two days or three
days.<a name="FNanchor_5_48" id="FNanchor_5_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> You will see." The female said again:
"No, they have been here a long time, ever since

Lion had indeed gone before them; the Deer followed.
They did not see Jaguar and Mountain Lion,
but they saw what they had done, pulling out
trees by the roots and breaking large rocks, so
that the Deer could follow them. The male said:
"See, they have pulled up trees, and broken
stones and rolled them about." Then after a time
they saw no more tracks: Jaguar and Mountain
Lion had made the wind blow so that the footprints
were effaced. The Deer went on nevertheless. When
Jaguar and Mountain Lion came to Hoalye-ketekururve,<a name="FNanchor_5_50" id="FNanchor_5_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
Jaguar, the older brother, sat down on the west

two Deer did not know they were sitting here, and
came on until they were between them. Jaguar, in
taking up his bow and arrow, made a slight noise,
the Deer heard it, and he did not shoot. But Mountain
Lion shot and hit the male. Deer said: "They
have failed: they did not shoot me in the right
place; they shot up into the sky, and the arrow
only dropped on me. I was struck, but I have no
pain." Then both Deer ran off eastward. (9 songs.)</p>

Lion went, and his older brother followed. They
did not see the tracks of the Deer, but they followed
them. They went up on the mesa. Jaguar said
to his younger brother: "Keep on: follow; do not
stop. I want to teach the people here, the Walapai
and Yavapai, to hunt. Some among them will dream
and then they will be deer hunters. Do not stop.
We could kill them here, but I do not want that.
We will wait until we come to Ama&#7789;-ahwa&#7789;-kut&#353;inakwe

When we kill them there, there will be blood on the
rocks: I want to name those places for that."</p>

and Ama&#7789;-axwa&#7789;-kw-i&#948;au, the male Deer had fallen
down dead. Now Mountain Lion stood to the east of
him, Jaguar on the west. Jaguar said: "You know
why I have pursued him. I want only the skin and
horns and sinew. You can have the meat: I do not
want it." But Mountain Lion said: "No, we will
divide it. I want the right horn. I too want some
of the things you want." Then Jaguar said: "I wanted
to divide it, but you did not want to. Well, you can
have it all." And he went off to the side and stood
there.<a name="FNanchor_5_52" id="FNanchor_5_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> So he had none of it. He went away to the
north, to Ama&#7789;-ke-hoalye, the Walapai Mountains.
But Mountain Lion stood by the Deer and tore his
body open with his claws. He put his hand inside and
took out the heart. Then he went north, holding that.
He did not take meat or skin or sinew or horns. He
left them and he went to Ahta-kwatmenve.<a name="FNanchor_5_53" id="FNanchor_5_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> (8 songs

<h2><a name="chap06" id="chap06"></a>VI. COYOTE</h2>


<h3><a name="chap06s1" id="chap06s1"></a>CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE RECORDING</h3>

<p>This group of narratives was told chiefly by
an old woman of the clan which names its daughters
M&#257;ha. Her more specific name was Mah-t&#353;itnyum&ecirc;ve.
She was a doctor for eyes that had
been made sore from being struck by mesquite
leaves or by a rushlike plant called hatelypo.
In curing, she breathed against the palm of her
hand held near her mouth, then laid the hand on
the eye. She got this power from Coyote in her
dream, as told in this story. She had a son
called Lahoka, who was also a doctor, for the
sickness caused by contact with foreign tribes.
He was alleged to have also the power to make
people sick, and at the time I knew his mother,
he had gone from Needles to live at the reservation
in Parker because of this accusation of
witchcraft.</p>

<p>I secured the Coyote material from Mah-t&#353;itnyum&ecirc;ve
near Needles on March 22, 1903, as
the result of an endeavor to learn more about
the place of Coyote in Mohave mythology. Coyote
is always mentioned in connection with the death
of Matavilya, as in the beginning of the Mastamho
myth (<a href="#chap07">VII</a>, <a href="#ch07para1">1-6</a>), but beyond that there were
mostly allusions only. This old lady said she had
dreamed a Coyote story which she was ready to
tell. It proved that she told it very badly. She
did not pursue a consistent thread and she left
contradictions which remained unresolved after
questioning. The fault is undoubtedly hers, not
my interpreter's, for Jack Jones was by this time
well trained. She said nothing of songs belonging
to the story, and I failed to enter in my notes
whether I asked her.</p>

<p>I do not know how far the narrator's deficiencies
were the result of her being a woman. She
was my only Mohave woman informant on matters of
myth and religion. I suspect she was unaccustomed
to narrating and therefore inexpert at it. A number
of people were listening in, some probably
members of the household and others casual visitors.
Several of these, including a man older
than the narrator and one younger, protested when
she concluded her main narrative (given as "A"
below). They declared that she had told not a
Coyote narrative, but a (private) dream, and that
it was not the sort of thing to tell. Their disapproval
seemed fairly strong. After this controversy
had subsided, she resumed and told the
briefer section given as "<a href="#chap06s2ss2">B</a>," but this again
evoked protest from an old man who was listening,
who said it was not a genuine Coyote story, but a
dream about killing people. All the Mohave listeners
seemed to take for granted that Mah-t&#353;itnyum&ecirc;ve
had dreamed what she alleged. Their
objection was to her dreaming the wrong sort of
thing.</p>

<p>Possibly these protests had their effect, or
the old lady ran out of what she had dreamed, because
she then dropped into telling conventional
Coyote tale episodes such as are told children&mdash;"<a href="#chap06s2ss3c">C</a>,
<a href="#chap06s2ss3d">D</a>, <a href="#chap06s2ss3e">E</a>." These in turn stimulated the interpreter
into telling several that he had heard&mdash;"<a href="#chap06s2ss4f">F</a>, <a href="#chap06s2ss4g">G</a>, <a href="#chap06s2ss4h">H</a>."</p>


<h3><a name="chap06s2" id="chap06s2"></a>THE TALES</h3>


<h4><a name="chap06s2ss1" id="chap06s2ss1"></a>A: Dreamed</h4>

<p>Coyote was a person like these Indians. There
were two Coyote brothers,<a name="FNanchor_6_1" id="FNanchor_6_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> little boys.<a name="FNanchor_6_2" id="FNanchor_6_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> They
started going from this country.<a name="FNanchor_6_3" id="FNanchor_6_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> They had bows
and arrows, and as they went along they shot at a
mark, betting their arrows. They would throw up a
bundle of arrowweeds to shoot at. The older won all
the younger brother's arrows. Then he took one,
wiped it on his anus, shot it up into a cottonwood
tree, and said: "Will you go get it for yourself?"
The little boy said: "No," and cried because the
arrow was soiled. So he was going to leave that
place and, crying, went north to &#952;aw&ecirc;ve, a place on
Cottonwood Island. Now I was following him.<a name="FNanchor_6_4" id="FNanchor_6_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> When
he got to &#952;aw&ecirc;ve, I did not see him any longer, so
I came back to this country here. Then I dreamed of
him again at Avi-hamoka, near Tehachapi.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_1" id="Footnote_6_1"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_1">[1]</a></span>
She later denied that they were brothers.

</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_2" id="Footnote_6_2"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_2">[2]</a></span>
The heroes as little boys is a favorite
Mohave motif.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_3" id="Footnote_6_3"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_3">[3]</a></span>
"This country," namely, Mohave valley, were
the informant's words. Most informants specify a
named place.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_4" id="Footnote_6_4"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_4">[4]</a></span>
This is pattern again: the narrator is present
at the myth-happening through having dreamed
it.</p>
</div>

<p>The older Coyote was called &#952;arra-veyo,<a name="FNanchor_6_5" id="FNanchor_6_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the
younger Pat&#353;a-karrawa. They were not brothers.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

first two syllables occur in the most common
name, Huk-&#952;ara.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_6">[6]</a></span>
Contradicting the former statement. See
footnote <a href="#Footnote_6_1">1</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>At Avi-kwa'ah&#257;&#952;a, a mountain beyond Phoenix in
Arizona, there lived an old man called Patak-sata.
This is a name of Coyote. With him at the same place
there lived a man called Hipahipa.<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> There were many
people there at Avi-kwa'ah&#257;&#952;a, among them a woman
called Qw&#257;q&#257;qta.<a name="FNanchor_6_8" id="FNanchor_6_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_7" id="Footnote_6_7"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_7">[7]</a></span>
Hipahipa is a personage, or at least a
name, that recurs in other tales: see Handbook,
p. 772. The word definitely refers to Coyote:
Hipa is the name given to all their daughters
by members of those lineages whose totemic
reference is Coyote.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_8" id="Footnote_6_8"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_8">[8]</a></span>
The informant said the name Qw&#257;q&#257;qta refers
to the crow or raven, aq&#257;qa; which sounds like
an improvised etymology.&mdash;The woman's relation
to the people at Avi-kwa'ah&#257;&#952;a is not clear. She
may have been a Mohave who was married among
Easterners.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
Now there was war between the Mohave and those
people. On that day Qw&#257;q&#257;qta bore a boy baby. Then
these people<a name="FNanchor_6_9" id="FNanchor_6_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> won, burned all the houses and food
and blankets and broke the dishes. They threw the
newly born child into the brush, but did not succeed
in killing it. Then they set fire to the brush,
but the boy baby made it rain and did not burn.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_9" id="Footnote_6_9"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_9">[9]</a></span>
My notes say "these people," which probably
means the Mohave, but might refer to the people
at Avi-kwa'ah&#257;&#952;a.</p>
</div>

<p>Then the old woman, his father's mother,
ha'auk,<a name="FNanchor_6_10" id="FNanchor_6_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> found him and made a roof shade and a
cradle for him and hung him up off the ground so
nothing could touch him while she went out to
look for inyeinye seeds for food.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_10" id="Footnote_6_10"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_10">[10]</a></span>
Father's mother is namau-(k). Ha'auk seems
really to denote the reciprocal of father's
mother, namely, woman's son's child, usually
given as a'avak. This would fit in with my suggested
explanation of the grandmother being an
Easterner and the boy being born among the
eastern tribe, although his mother was a Mohave.
In answer to a question who the boy's father was,
the informant said she did not know, except that
he was a Coyote.</p>
</div>

<p>She was gone all day. The baby was intelligent
and after she was gone, he made black balls
(vanyeilk) from his own breath by magic. Before
long many quail came to where he was hung up,
and he snapped or filliped (harr&ecirc;mk) the balls
at them and killed them. Then he piled the birds
into a heap and went back into his cradle.<a name="FNanchor_6_11" id="FNanchor_6_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_11" id="Footnote_6_11"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_11">[11]</a></span>
The supernaturally precocious hero, who
kills game from his cradle and then climbs back
to it, is told of in other tales of Yuman tribes.</p>
</div>

<p>When his grandmother came, she said: "Who
brought them here? Who did it? I am an old woman
and I surely like to eat meat, but I did not
think that someone would bring them under my
shade roof." She was very angry and began to
curse who did it. She said: "Kweva-namaue-napaue."<a name="FNanchor_6_12" id="FNanchor_6_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_12" id="Footnote_6_12"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_12">[12]</a></span>
"That is how Indian women say son-of-a-bitch,"
the interpreter explained. The cursing
consists of stringing together the names of
three grandparents, who are presumably dead, and
allusion to whom is therefore the height of
shocking offense. The three terms are: (na)-kweu-(k),
mother's father; namau-(k), father's
mother; napau-(k), father's father.</p>
</div>

<p>The boy grew up. Then they returned to this
country,<a name="FNanchor_6_13" id="FNanchor_6_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> he and his grandmother. The Mohave
Indians went to Phoenix to fight the people at
Avi-kwa'ah&#257;&#952;a, and he went along. Pat&#353;a-karrawa
was his name.<a name="FNanchor_6_14" id="FNanchor_6_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_13" id="Footnote_6_13"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_13">[13]</a></span>
"This country" can only mean Mohave valley.
It is not clear why they should be "returning"
if the old woman belonged to a tribe on the Gila
River and the boy was born there, as suggested
in note <a href="#Footnote_6_10">10</a>. The whole story is involved in minor
obscurities of telling.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_14" id="Footnote_6_14"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_14">[14]</a></span>
The baby is now supposed to be grown up.
His name identifies him with the younger of the
two Coyotes with whom the first paragraph deals.
It would seem that the bulk of the story ought
to precede in time, the first paragraph really
being the end of the story; but the two sections
are given in the order in which the informant
told them.</p>
</div>

<p>Now he went ahead of the others, like a leader,
to spy them out and see where the houses were. On
the desert he found his mother. She was a slave
there. He said to her: "Do not tell them when you
go back home that I met you here. Take these birds
and rabbits with you, but do not tell that I gave
them to you. Say that you found them." She had on
her back her pack basket.<a name="FNanchor_6_15" id="FNanchor_6_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Into this she put the
game he gave her. He entered it too. He said: "Let
me get into your basket. I will make myself into a
bird so that they will not know me. Carry me back,
but do not tell who I am. You may tell them tomorrow."</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_15" id="Footnote_6_15"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_15">[15]</a></span>
The k&#363;po is the peculiar pack basket of
the Mohave, which consists of two crossed sticks
bent into U-shape and wound around with string
spaced an inch or so apart.</p>
</div>

<p>So she returned and gave the rabbits and birds
to the people. They wanted to know where she got
them, but she would not tell. Then Patak-sata
said: "Let me look at them. I think Pat&#353;a-karrawa
killed these." He knew it right, but she would not
admit it. In the morning she said: "I have another
bird in my basket, a dove." Then Patak-sata said:
"Let me see it." She gave it to him. "That is not
a dove," he said, "I know it. Pat&#353;a-karrawa made
himself into this. I can tell a dove by its bill.
And when you see a dove, it shakes its head. This
does not." Soon after, on that day, the Mohave
arrived and attacked. While the fight was going
on, Qw&#257;q&#257;qta stood on the roof and sang as follows:</p>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Song and translation">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdlt">i&#952;auwe</td>

    <td class="tdlt">ahwe-kan&#257;m</td>
    <td class="tdlfin">abroad-tell</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdlt">ha&#952;o'ilya</td>
    <td class="tdlfin">to the sea</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Then she sang:</p>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Song and translation">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdlt">hunapnap</td>
    <td class="tdlfin">butterfly</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdlt">mat-ut&#353;avek</td>
    <td class="tdlfin">he made himself</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdlt">mat-apui</td>
    <td class="tdlfin">killed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdlt">me&#952;kemew&ecirc;-mote</td>
    <td class="tdlfin">he cannot be</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdlt">sumat&#353;-ah&ocirc;tem</td>
    <td class="tdlfin">he dreamed well</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Then the Mohave killed all the people at Avi-kwa'ah&#257;&#952;a,
and took Pat&#353;a-karrawa's mother as a
slave and brought her back to this country. Then she
said: "Where there is war, notify other tribes and
then gather: my son is wise and cannot be beaten."</p>

<p>Now he and his mother were poor and had nothing
to eat. There was much food here among the people,
but no one gave them anything to eat.<a name="FNanchor_6_16" id="FNanchor_6_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Then he
took his mother and went west with her to Avi-hamoka.<a name="FNanchor_6_17" id="FNanchor_6_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
There they lived.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_16" id="Footnote_6_16"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_16">[16]</a></span>
The withholding of food is entirely unmotivated
by the narrator. Perhaps it is because they
were Easterners and foreigners.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_17" id="Footnote_6_17"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_17">[17]</a></span>
This is the place near Tehachapi mentioned
at the end of the first paragraph, where the informant
dreamed of him. Subsequently, when she
was asked to give more information about this
dreaming, she said that Coyote had a man's shape;
but she now stated that it was at Ha'avulypo,
at the rear of the house there, that she dreamed
of him. Her dream was of the time before "Matavilya
was born." (Perhaps a slip of my pencil
for Mastamho?)</p>

<h4><a name="chap06s2ss2" id="chap06s2ss2"></a>B: Dreamed</h4>

<p>This country was full of coyotes. Then we became
Mohaves, human beings: the coyotes turned
into people. There is a place called Huk&#952;ara-ny-eny&ecirc;ve,
a small mountain south of Mukiampeve,
Needles Peak.<a name="FNanchor_6_18" id="FNanchor_6_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> There is where Kway&#363;<a name="FNanchor_6_19" id="FNanchor_6_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> lived, at
Huk&#952;ara-ny-eny&ecirc;ve: he belonged to this country.
Whenever he saw a child, he seized it, stuck it
under his belt, and took it home. There he would
put them into a hole in the rock, pound them up,
and eat them. Sometimes he ate them raw, sometimes
he roasted them in the fire. All the people
were afraid of him.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_18" id="Footnote_6_18"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_18">[18]</a></span>
Mukiampeve is the standard form of the name;
Okiampeve is what the informant was understood
as saying.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_19" id="Footnote_6_19"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_19">[19]</a></span>
Kway&#363; means a meteor or fireball, usually
conceived of as a monster or man-eater. He recurs
in the Cane story.</p>
</div>

<p>Now the Crayfish, Hal(y)kut&#257;&#7789;a,<a name="FNanchor_6_20" id="FNanchor_6_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> killed Kway&#363;.
He was little, but when he became angry, he made
himself into a big man. So all the people were
saved. If Crayfish had not killed him, Kway&#363; would
have eaten everyone up. After killing him, Crayfish
took him far south to the ocean where he
lived and ate him up. So there was no more Kway&#363;
in this land here.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_20" id="Footnote_6_20"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_20">[20]</a></span>
Hal(y)kut&#257;ta was described as a "bug" as
long as a finger, with long legs, a back like a
scorpion, living in the water in sloughs, but

<p>Coyote was hunting, but killed nothing. Then
he took deer excrement, planted them like seeds,
and built a brush fence around. In four days the
deer had grown as big as dogs: then he ate them.</p>


<h5><a name="chap06s2ss3d" id="chap06s2ss3d"></a>D</h5>

<p>When Coyote was hungry, he ate his children.
"My daughter, climb this tree," he said. When
she had climbed up, he piled brush around the
tree and set fire to it. The girl fell down and
into the fire and he ate her.</p>

<p>Stories like this are not dreamed, but are
heard from other people and are told to children.</p>


<h5><a name="chap06s2ss3e" id="chap06s2ss3e"></a>E</h5>

<p>One Coyote said to another, "Let us set fire
all around to this patch of thick brush. I think
there must be deer, rats, and rabbits in it which
we cannot get at. But if we set fire to the brush
all around, they will burn up and we can just
pick them up and eat them." Then they set fire to
the patch, but one Coyote went inside first and
stood in the middle. When the fire came near him,
he had a song which would make him sink into the
ground to his ankle. His second song would make
him sink in to the middle of his calf (or the middle
of his body); the third, to his knee (or neck).
And with the fourth song he would be completely
under the ground so the fire could not touch him.
Now when the flames began to come near him, he
sang his song: hilyhavek kerropsim, enter descend.
But he did not begin to sink into the ground. He
sang again and still did not penetrate. By the
time he had sung his fourth song, the fire reached
him and he burned up.</p>

<p>Coyote went out and met Quail. Quail said to
him: "Pluck my feathers and then send me to your
wife to cook me." Coyote plucked him and Quail came
to Coyote's old woman and said: "He says you are
to cook your sandals."</p>

<p>"He is crazy."</p>

<p>"That's what he said. 'Cook your sandals!' Tell
her that, he said."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"You have a pair, have you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you are to cook them."</p>

<p>So she started to cook her sandals. Meanwhile
Quail lay down outside under the shade roof. After
a while Coyote came home.</p>

<p>"What are you cooking?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"What you sent me word to."</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?"</p>

<p>"To cook my sandals."</p>

<p>"Who was it said so?"</p>

<p>"Quail."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Outside in the shade."</p>

<p>Quail was lying there laughing. When Coyote
came running up, he fled till he came to a slough.
There he sat quietly on a tree. When Coyote arrived,
he saw his reflection in the water, thought it was
Quail, jumped in to seize him, and drowned. Then
his old woman came too, tried to pull him out, but
fell in and drowned also.</p>

<p>Coyote was visiting Beaver, his friend. Beaver
had nothing to eat, but he had four or five children,
so he killed them, cooked them, and gave

them to Coyote to eat. But he warned him: "Do not
throw away any of the bones. Lay them aside."
When they had eaten, Beaver took the bones, threw
them in the water, and they turned into living
beavers again.</p>

<p>Then after a while Beaver came to visit Coyote.
Coyote had no food, so he killed his young ones
and cooked them. "Do not throw away the bones,
but put them carefully aside," he warned him.
Then after the meal, he threw the bones into
water. But no young coyotes came out, and the
bones were gone.</p>

<h2><a name="chap07" id="chap07"></a>VII. MASTAMHO</h2>


<h3><a name="chap07s1" id="chap07s1"></a>THE INFORMANT</h3>

<p>This story of the institution of culture differs
from most of the preceding in that it is a
pure myth unaccompanied by songs. It was told to
me at the University's Museum of Anthropology,
then in San Francisco, between November 16 and
24, 1903, by Jo Nelson, also called Baby's Head
in Mohave; with Jack Jones the interpreter as
usual.</p>

<p>Jo Nelson, aged about sixty, is pictured in
Handbook of California Indians, plate 64, top
right, and in our frontispiece. Like many
Mohave, he was interested in travel and in new
lands and peoples. He had visited widely among
Indian tribes both east and west of the Mohave
and had asked questions both abroad and at home.
He gave me, on the whole, the best information
which I secured from the Mohave about other
tribes, and which has been published in part in
the Handbook, though considerable detail remains
unpublished. Jo Nelson was in many ways an ideal
informant for matters of fact. His memory was
excellent both for what he had seen and heard.
His mind was orderly, his procedure methodical.
He distinguished between hearsay and actual observation;
and he would exhaust one topic before
proceeding to the next. These same qualities
show in his myth as presented here.</p>


<h3><a name="chap07s2" id="chap07s2"></a>CONTENT OF THE MYTH</h3>

<p>The narrative may be described as dealing
essentially with the institution of culture by
Mastamho, the second of the two great myth heroes
of the Mohave. The story assumes the cosmogony as
such as already known. I obtained one such Mohave
account of the origin of the world. This has been
abstracted in the Handbook, pages 770-771, and
also in the American Journal of Folklore, 19:314-316,
1906. That was one of the first narratives
which I recorded from this tribe, and its quality
and my rendition are not of the best; but it is
confirmed by innumerable allusions to world origins
in other Mohave myths and in their discussions
of their culture.</p>

<p>The present Mastamho narrative begins after
Matavilya is dead, and its first chapter, so to
speak (<a href="#ch07para1">A:1-6</a>) deals with the disposal of his body.
Thereafter the tale is concerned with the planning,
trials, and execution of his plans by Mastamho,
especially with reference to the way of living of
the Mohave, but first for the desert tribes nearest
them (<a href="#ch07para7">B:7-19</a>). Essentially Mastamho thinks of
what will be good for one or more of these tribes,
causes it to come into existence, and then explains
it to the people or has them practice it.
One long section (<a href="#ch07para20">C:20-35</a>) is devoted to the institution
of night and sleep, to the building of
houses and shade roofs, and the setting aside of
playing fields. The relation of sections like this
to the remainder will be clearer by reference to
the outline of the whole narrative given a few
paragraphs below. The total story is so prolix
that this summary will be useful as a conspectus
for orientation.</p>

<p>Another section (<a href="#ch07para36">D:36-42</a>) is devoted to the
making of the wild plants which spring up either
of themselves, or through being planted, in the
bottoms of the Mohave valley immediately upon the
recession of the annual overflow. The Mohave distinguish
between wild food plants which grow of
themselves but are harvested, wild food plants
which are sown, and domesticated food plants such
as maize and beans. The second group, in other
words, are cultivated plants which also grow spontaneously
in the Colorado bottoms, but probably
grow in denser stands if sown. They were apparently
seed-bearing plants which were particularly adapted
to rapid growth in the summer heat following the
June inundation; and this fact may have contributed
to their not having been diffused to other environments.
At any rate, it is to be noted that the narrator
gave considerably more space to the institution
of these wild and "tame-wild" plants than to strictly
agricultural ones.</p>

<p>By the time he comes to the latter, it is near
the end of Mastamho's career and the episode seems
hurried (<a href="#ch07para76">H:76-78</a>). Pottery is mentioned first and
agriculture second; which may be an accident, but I
suspect that it reflects a Mohave attitude. At any
rate, it is clear that they strongly associate pottery
and agriculture, which is not surprising in
view of the absence or underdevelopment of both
among many of the tribes to the west, north, and
east. That the telling of the story in this section
was hurried, or perhaps shortened by fatigue, is
indicated by the fact that, strictly speaking, the
instituting of neither art is described, but they
are taken for granted and then Mastamho teaches the
people the names of vessels and plants. This creation
by naming may pass as a shorthand explanation, but it
is not in the narrator's usual methodical manner.</p>

<p>There is a section, as might be expected, on
hawks and warfare (<a href="#ch07para59">F:59-69</a>), this being a subject
the Mohave never tire of. It is men who dream of
hawks that become successful fighters and renowned
war leaders.</p>

<p>A rather unusual section deals with Mastamho's
trial-and-error attempts to teach the names for
tribes, objects, and the numeral count (<a href="#ch07para43">E:43-58</a>).
Here the device is to begin with distortions of the
Mohave words which, however, the taught fail or
refuse to learn. The distortions are something on
the order of Pig Latin or the languages which groups
of children sometimes concoct. This sort of attempt
is not commonly found among North American Indians,
and the techniques of distortion have therefore been
analyzed in a separate discussion appended to the
tale itself. On account of its fixed sequence, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
numeral count perhaps lends itself best to word
plays of this sort. In not a few languages, including
Mohave, succeeding numerals partly rhyme.
This feature has been further developed in the
artificial counts. The whole process is somewhat
akin to the occasional instances of the count
in a foreign language being parodied by substitution
of somewhat like-sounding names in the
speaker's language, a device with which obscene
or other humorous effects can easily be attained.</p>

<p>A fair question would be how much of Mohave
culture is accounted for in all this narrative
of institution. A fair answer would seem to be:
most of the more conspicuous, concrete features
of the culture, houses and their parts, weapons,
utensils, food plants. This omits certain items
from what we are wont to call material culture,
such as clothing, cradles, and the like. But the
technological and economic deficiencies of the
Colorado River Yuman culture are so definite
that the omissions are perhaps in the minority.</p>

<p>Having done his work, Mastamho goes off and
turns into the bald eagle (<a href="#ch07para82">J:82-84</a>). This is
spoken of as "dying" or "leaving his body." He
is said to have become "crazy," which probably
means without sense, knowing nothing, without
human consciousness.</p>

<p>There follows a long supplement, making about
a quarter of the total story (<a href="#ch07para85">K-N:85-102</a>), which
tells of the institution of sex, courtship, and
marriage under the leadership of a man and a woman
to whom Mastamho has delegated this task and who
at its conclusion turn the people with them into
birds and themselves become, respectively, the
curve-billed thrasher and the mockingbird. The
guess may be hazarded that Mastamho is to the Mohave
too heroic a figure to be credited with
undertaking the institution of these practices
in person. At that, the treatment is restrained
and, from the native point of view, thoroughly
decent, though the emphasis is on festivals,
playfields, and courtship.</p>

<h3><a name="chap07s4" id="chap07s4"></a>QUALITY OF THE NARRATIVE</h3>

<p>So much for the content of the narrative: now
as to its form. First of all, although the story
is not accompanied by songs, it is developed according
to the same pattern as the song-cycle
myths. Moreover, the informant was just as insistent
as the majority of narrators that he got
his knowledge through dreaming.</p>

<p>However, the approach in the telling is less
formally decorative and more rational than in
other narratives. There is actually less story,
in the sense of there being a minimum of events,
a maximum of explanation. The account is therefore
bald and didactic. One sees the narrator
throughout aiming to be clear even at the cost of
repetition or prolixity.</p>

<p>In fact, repetition is deliberately indulged
in as part of the didactic style. Mastamho talks
to himself of what he will do, then perhaps tells
the people that he will do it, then goes and does
it; after which, he may explain to them what he
has done. Or he will have them try the innovation,
in which case it may be four times before they
learn, or before he finds the correct manner.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the pace throughout is tantalizingly
slow. The story could have been condensed
by me, but its characteristic manner and style
would thereby have been completely discarded.
There are constant references to "This will be,
but it is not yet." Such antitheses seem to
serve both emphasis and clarity. For instance,
paragraph <a href="#ch07para62">62</a>, "If people dream of you, they will
kill enemies; if people dream of being in darkness,
they will not kill them." Or again, paragraph
<a href="#ch07para70">70</a>, "I will not let you go to a distance:
I want you to stay in this country." Balances of
this sort constitute a distinct stylistic manner,
rudimentary though the devices may be from a literary
point of view.</p>

<p>The Mastamho account contains certain minor
inconsistencies, but they are not inconsistencies
of identity or kinship of person, or of topography,
as in the Cane narrative; nor are they due to
sloppiness of telling, as in the Coyote stories.
The chief inconsistencies noted are the fact that
Mastamho keeps saying that he will teach the people
everything in four nights before his transformation
into the bald eagle, but then actually is six
nights doing it; and similarly he at first separates
the people into four future tribes&mdash;three in
the desert and the Mohave&mdash;but then later there
are six, the River Kamia and Yuma suddenly appearing
with the Mohave. These discrepancies should
not be charged too seriously against the narrator's
care and precision. The story is an exceedingly
long one. He told it at intervals during nine days.
Part of my time was tied to University duties, so
that there would be whole days of interruption.
While I made no detailed record, I assume that we
spent at least four working days in the telling
and Englishing. This would mean a minimum of two
days, or say twelve to fifteen hours, of Mohave
narration by the informant, distributed over more
than a week. Few people could follow one thread of
telling so long as this with so few discrepancies.</p>

<h4>A. Mastamho Disposes of Dead Matavilya: 1-6</h4>

<p><a name="ch07para1" id="ch07para1"></a>1. Matavilya's death and pyre at Ha'avulypo.&mdash;Matavilya
died at Ha'avulypo.<a name="FNanchor_7_1" id="FNanchor_7_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I did not see him
when he was sick, but dreamed of him and saw him
only when he died; others know of his sickness.
When he died in the house,<a name="FNanchor_7_2" id="FNanchor_7_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> they carried him west
of the door. Now Mastamho was a boy about so high
(about ten-year size). They asked: "What shall we
do with him?" Then Mastamho told them: "Burn him.
When people die I want you to burn them. That is
what I wish. Now I want you, Badger,<a name="FNanchor_7_3" id="FNanchor_7_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to dig a
hole; and I want this man, Raccoon,<a name="FNanchor_7_4" id="FNanchor_7_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to bring wood."
Then after a time these two men came back into the
house and said: "We have dug a hole and the wood
is ready." Now there were many people there in the
house when they said that, but not one of them
spoke a word. Then Mastamho asked them: "Have you
fire?" But Badger and Raccoon said: "No."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para2" id="ch07para2"></a>2. Coyote seeks fire.&mdash;Now Coyote&mdash;&#952;ara-veyo-ve,
Mastamho called him, but the Mohave call him Huk&#952;ara&mdash;said:
"I am sorry because Matavilya died:
I want fire and will bring it. I will go to Fire-Mountain:<a name="FNanchor_7_5" id="FNanchor_7_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
I know there is fire there and will get
it." So he started westward. He was gone a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
time. Mastamho waited and all the others waited.
Then Mastamho said: "I do not want it to become
day, for Matavilya to be lying here in the light.
Let it remain night." Now they were all still
waiting for Coyote, but he did not return: he was
still traveling west.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="ch07para3" id="ch07para3"></a>3. Fly and the cremation.&mdash;Then &#952;ilyahmo, Fly,
a woman&mdash;for there were only people then, and no
animals&mdash;who had been sitting west of the door,
went outside, pulled up dead arrowweeds, came
back indoors, broke the sticks up, and dropped
them into two or three small piles; for she
wanted to try to make fire. Then she plucked off
a strand of her willow-bark dress and rubbed it
fine into tinder. Then she twirled a stick in
her hands, and with this and the shredded bark
she made fire, as she sat in the corner of the
house by the west side of the door. Then she
carried it into the middle of the house, saying:
"Here is fire." Now that they had fire, Badger
and Raccoon carried Matavilya outdoors and laid
him down on their pile of wood. All who had been
in the house went out with them. Then Badger and
Raccoon returned into the house and brought out
the fire. Lighting the pile of wood at the north
end, they went one along each side of it, setting
fire to it, until they met at the south end.
There they stood. Then everyone cried, Badger and
Raccoon with the rest.</p>

<p><a name="ch07para4" id="ch07para4"></a>4. Coyote's theft of the heart.&mdash;Now when Coyote
arrived at Fire-Mountain, he looked back and
saw the burning at Ha'avulypo. Then he did not
even stop to take the fire, but ran back at once.
When he arrived, he found the people all standing
around the pyre. He said: "Matavilya is dead and
I do not know anything. How am I to? He told me
nothing." He ran around and around the circle of
people who were standing and crying for Matavilya.
He cried too. Now Mastamho was standing on a
higher place to the north, looking at Coyote.
Though he was only a boy, he was thinking about
him. He thought: "I know what he wants: he is not
really sorry." What Coyote wanted was to jump
over the ring of people, to seize Matavilya's
heart and run away with it: that is why he was
trying to come near the fire. But the people,
standing close together, would not let him. Now
they were all tall; but Badger and Raccoon were
both short. Then Coyote jumped: he succeeded in
leaping over their two heads, and he got to the
fire. But Mastamho said: "Did I not know it? That
is Coyote's way: he has no sense. When a person
really mourns he does not take away the heart of
the dead. But now Coyote will go away: I do not
want him here. And I do not want him ever to know
anything. I want you who are standing here to
know something, and I will do many things for
you. But let him go off and be Coyote. He will
always be without a home in the mountains. If
you see him you will kill him, because he knows
nothing." After Coyote had seized Matavilya's
heart, he ran southwestward, beyond Avikwame to
Ama&#7789;a-hotave. There he stopped and looked south.
But the heart was still too hot to hold; so he
dropped it, turned around, and held his mouth open
towards the north to let the wind cool it.<a name="FNanchor_7_6" id="FNanchor_7_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Then
as the heart lay on the ground and cooled, Coyote
ate it.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_6" id="Footnote_7_6"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_7_6">[6]</a></span>
Mathak, north, means windward.</p></div>

<p><a name="ch07para5" id="ch07para5"></a>5. Covering of the ashes.&mdash;Now Coyote thought:
"I will go to Aksam-kusaveve and tell Hame'ulye-kwit&#353;e-i&#948;ulye."
So he went to Aksam-kusaveve and
told Hame'ulye-kwit&#353;e-i&#948;ulye: "Matavilya has died:
go to see him: I am announcing it everywhere."
Then Hame'ulye-kwit&#353;e-i&#948;ulye went to Ha'avulypo.
When he found where Matavilya had been burned, he
thought: "What shall I do with these?" So he rolled
himself over the ashes. No one had covered Matavilya's
ashes and it was that which Hame'ulye-kwit&#353;e-i&#948;ulye
did not like to see exposed; that is
why he covered them with sand by rolling over them.
Then he returned to Aksam-kusaveve.</p>

<p><a name="ch07para6" id="ch07para6"></a>6. Coyote abandoned, homeless.&mdash;Now Coyote too
came back to Ha'avulypo. No one was there now,
for Mastamho had taken the people away to Kwaparvete,
a short distance southward. He had seen Coyote
coming and had thought: "I do not want to tell
him what I know: I want him to be foolish and know
nothing: I do not want him to hear what I say. I
will let him go. He will be the only one like that,
the one I call Coyote. He will not know his own
home: he will want to run about the desert and do
what is bad. If someone is not at home, Coyote will
go there; but if a person is in his house, he will
not come; and if anyone sees him, he will run off."</p>


<h4>B. Avikwame, River, Desert Land
and Foods Made: 7-19</h4>

<p><a name="ch07para7" id="ch07para7"></a>7. Mastamho promises to teach.&mdash;Now Mastamho
said: "There is no house here, and no shade roof.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
I have not made everything as yet; it will take
time to do that. I know you are hot or cold, and
hungry, and without houses; but I will provide
everything. The sun and the night have not yet been
made, but I will make them; and I will tell you
what to eat. Then you will know how to live."</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_7_7">[7]</a></span>
Ramada, arbor.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para8" id="ch07para8"></a>8. Arrival at Avikwame.&mdash;Now they went downriver
to Avikwame. There was no mountain there then; the
land was level. Mastamho said: "Now we have come
to this place and I will do something for you. I
want you to learn how to make pottery, and then to
know what food is good to eat. You will learn how
to know day and night. And you will not be hungry
nor thirsty. When you are cold, you will know it<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and will make a fire, and will have a house to
live in. And so when you are hungry you will eat,
and when you are thirsty you will drink. I will make
mortars, metates, cooking pots, drinking cups, and
water jars. I will tell you all about those things.
When Matavilya died, you were ignorant, but I
thought and knew. Therefore I will do these things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
that I say; only I cannot do them now, at once.
It will take a long time yet to do them." Now
Mastamho had no one to help him, no one to join
with him in talking. He was alone: while there
were many people there, they did not speak. Then
he thought: "After I have done other things for
them, I will give them names." Now the people
did not sleep, but constantly stood, or sometimes
sat, and when the sun went down Mastamho talked
to them. For four nights he spoke to them.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_8" id="Footnote_7_8"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_7_8">[8]</a></span>
"At that time they felt neither cold nor
hunger, but walked on and on."</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para9" id="ch07para9"></a>9. White-spring made for the Chemehuevi.&mdash;On
the fourth morning he said: "Now I am old enough.
I will go west. I will not go far, I will take
only four steps, but I will do something for
you." He was intending to make a spring. So as
soon as the sun had risen, he walked four steps
west to Aha-kwi-nyamasave.<a name="FNanchor_7_9" id="FNanchor_7_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> He put his weight on
the ground, thinking: "Let me see if it is hard."
As he stepped on it, he found that it was soft,
like mud. So he went toward the north four steps.
There he stood, stretched out his hand backward,
and had in it a stick of sandbar willow, a forearm
long.<a name="FNanchor_7_10" id="FNanchor_7_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This stick he set into the ground.
When he pulled it out, water came with it. Then
he put his foot against the water as it flowed
out, and pushed earth over it, until there was
only a small stream. Then he returned. When he
was again at Avikwame, he said: "If I had been
so sorry for my father<a name="FNanchor_7_11" id="FNanchor_7_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that I had immediately
turned myself into a bird, you would now know
nothing. But I want to do everything for you:
I want to make things for you. I call you Hamakhava,
Mohave. Now I have made a spring in the
west: I will give that to the Chemehuevi. Those
sitting here on the west side will be the Chemehuevi.
Now I will stay here four days and then I
will go north to Hatasa&#7789;a."</p>

Nakutk, my father. Other accounts, perhaps
less influenced by Christianity, make Mastamho
the younger brother of Matavilya. The narrator
subsequently added: Mastamho said: "Matavilya is
my father. I was born at night. Then he said to
me: 'I give you a name. I call you Tinyam-humare,
night-child.'" After Matavilya died, Mastamho no
longer liked to hear this name and called himself
Mastamho.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para10" id="ch07para10"></a>10. Colorado River, fish, and ducks made at
Hatasa&#7789;a for the Mohave.&mdash;After four days he
went to Hatasa&#7789;a. From there he went west a short
distance to Hiv&#952;ikevutat&#353;e. He said: "They are
not named, but I will give these names to these
two places. I will not go farther but return."
He had with him the stick he had got at Aha-kwi-nyamasave,
was using it as an old man uses a
cane. So he came back to Hatasa&#7789;a, and there he
set the stick into the ground. When he drew it
out, water came with it. With his foot, he pushed
earth over it, thinking: "What beings shall I let
issue with the water, animals that will be useful
for the Mohave?" Four times he allowed water to
come and stopped it again. The first time At&#353;i-mikulye<a name="FNanchor_7_12" id="FNanchor_7_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
emerged. The next time At&#353;i-yonyene<a name="FNanchor_7_13" id="FNanchor_7_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
swam out, and the third time, At&#353;i-hane.<a name="FNanchor_7_14" id="FNanchor_7_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The
fourth time At&#353;i-t&#353;ehnap, also called At&#353;i-t&#353;ehe&#952;ilye,<a name="FNanchor_7_15" id="FNanchor_7_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
came out. Mastamho thought: "I will
give these to the Mohave." Next Av'akwa&#952;pine<a name="FNanchor_7_16" id="FNanchor_7_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
came out, and then Puk-havasu.<a name="FNanchor_7_17" id="FNanchor_7_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Then there came
Hanemo.<a name="FNanchor_7_18" id="FNanchor_7_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Then Hanyewilye, the mudhen, emerged.
As each came out, fish and ducks, he did not let
them go, but kept them there. He made only a little
water, enough to hold them. Whenever he left his
stick plunged into the ground, the water did not
issue; but when he drew it out, the water and the
fish and the birds came out. When he had finished
making the fish and the ducks, he said: "These are
for the Mohave, but they do not yet know how to
catch them. I will teach them."</p>

Hanemo is the name commonly used for ducks
generically. It is also the specific name of the
pintail or wood duck. The four ducks mentioned here
reappear with other water birds in par. <a href="#ch07para96">96</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para11" id="ch07para11"></a>11. Matavilya's ashes washed away.&mdash;Then he
drew out his stick entirely, and the water came
unrestrained, with the fish and ducks in it, and
flowed southward.<a name="FNanchor_7_19" id="FNanchor_7_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Mastamho ran ahead of it on the
west bank, to Ha'avulypo where Matavilya had been
burned. There he set his stick into the center of
the ashes, for he did not like to see them and
wanted the water to wash them out. He called to
the water, and it ran where he held his stick,
and the ashes were washed away. So they were gone,
and the river flowed through the place where they
had been.</p>

As the Colorado River.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para12" id="ch07para12"></a>12. Boat tilted to widen valley.&mdash;But Mastamho
went back up to Hatasa&#7789;a. Putting his stick into
the same place as before, from which the water now
issued, he stirred it around. Then a boat, kasukye,
came out. Mastamho called it kanu&#952;kye,<a name="FNanchor_7_20" id="FNanchor_7_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> but the
Mohave name is kulho. As the boat emerged, Mastamho
put his foot on it, held it, entered it, and
floated down. Where the river was not broad enough
to suit him, he stood on the edge of the boat until
it lay far on its side. Then the river became wide
there. Thus he went down to Avikwame, where the
people were. As they saw him coming down the river
and then going by, they thought that he would leave
them. At Aqwaq-iove<a name="FNanchor_7_21" id="FNanchor_7_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> he waved his hands to them,
meaning: "Stay where you are: I will return." When
he approached the lower end of Mohave valley, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
thought: "I think some one else has taken the
boat long ago,<a name="FNanchor_7_22" id="FNanchor_7_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and that it will not be suitable
for the Mohave. So I cannot let them have it: I
will let it go." And when he came near where
Mellen is now, he jumped off the boat, shoving
it away with his foot: so that it floated downstream.
Mastamho stood at Mepuk-t&#353;ivauve<a name="FNanchor_7_23" id="FNanchor_7_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and
watched it going down. When it came to Ahwe-nye-va,<a name="FNanchor_7_24" id="FNanchor_7_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
it no longer drifted tilted, but floated
level. Then the valley land there became wide,
and the river also; but wherever the boat
floated tilted, the river and the valley were
narrow. Then Mastamho returned to Avikwame.</p>

<p><a name="ch07para13" id="ch07para13"></a>13. Avikwame mountain made from mud.&mdash;Now
there was no mountain at Avikwame at that time.
There was only a flat and the river. The people
stood on the bank. But the water was not near
them; as the water receded, it left mud. Mastamho
took up some of this mud and let it drop.
As it fell, he said: "Goloto," as little boys
say when they splash mud in play. He did that
repeatedly. He said: "Let it be higher, and let
the river flow by it. After this mountain which
I am making is dry, I will make a house for you:
You will be in that."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para14" id="ch07para14"></a>14. Other mountains made.&mdash;Thus Mastamho made

<p><a name="ch07para15" id="ch07para15"></a>15. Four seed foods made for the Chemehuevi.&mdash;Then
he went westward to Huk&#952;ara-t&#353;-huerve. He
took up a handful of fine gravel, put it in his
mouth, then blew it out, wishing to make something
to eat for the people who would live in these
mountains that he had made. He thought: "I will
make kwa&#952;apilye seeds: they will be good for the
Chemehuevi." Then he took more gravel and spat it
out in another direction, but also westward, saying:
"I now will make ma-selye'aya seeds. They too
will be good for Chemehuevi; they will grind and
parch them with coals and have them for food." Then
he ran northward to Avi-nyilyk-kwas-ekunyive, put
gravel into his mouth and spat it out over the
ground. "This that I plant is malysa,"<a name="FNanchor_7_31" id="FNanchor_7_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> he said.
Again he took up gravel and blew it out, saying:
"This that I plant is t&#353;ilypeve." When he had
planted these four kinds for the Chemehuevi, he
said: "That is all that I can do. You have seen
me: it is all that I can make. No one will be
able to sow these and make them grow: they will
grow by themselves every year." Then he returned
to Avikwame and told the Chemehuevi and the Paiute:
"I have planted food for you. I have planted
kwa&#952;apilye and ma-selye'aya and malysa and t&#353;ilypeve
for you. But wait: do not hurry."</p>

</div>

<p><a name="ch07para16" id="ch07para16"></a>16. Four plant foods made for the Walapai.&mdash;Then
he said: "Next I am going east, to make mountains
there; I want people to live in them. I will
start in four days." After four days he started,
crossed the river, and went downstream to Avi-veskwi.<a name="FNanchor_7_32" id="FNanchor_7_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
There he stood and looked back down toward
the river, and thought: "It is not very far.
Let me go farther east, to Kit&#353;ehayare."<a name="FNanchor_7_33" id="FNanchor_7_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> So he
went on till he came to Kit&#353;ehayare. There he did
as he had done before. He put gravel in his mouth
and spat it over the earth. He said: "This is what
I plant: I plant vannata."<a name="FNanchor_7_34" id="FNanchor_7_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Again he took a handful
of sand and blew it out. "This that I am planting
is va&#948;ilye,<a name="FNanchor_7_34a" id="FNanchor_7_34a"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_34a" class="fnanchor">[34a]</a> mescal." From there he went north
and said: "I call this place Coyote's water;<a name="FNanchor_7_35" id="FNanchor_7_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> it
will be good for Coyote. He has no home: when he
finds this water he will drink of it. I do not make
it for him, but he will find it." Now he stood
there. Then he stripped the leaves from the tops
of the brush called kamomka and put them into his
mouth. He blew them out and thus made i&#948;it&#353;a, the
wild grape. "I want it to grow in this spot," he
said. Then as he stood there he scraped his foot to
one side, and grass came up. He said: "I thought
when I did that it would grow." Then, covering it
up again with his foot, he took of the sand with
which he covered it, put it in his mouth, blew it
out, and kum&#948;ur<a name="FNanchor_7_36" id="FNanchor_7_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> grew. Now he had made four things
for the people who were to be here. He had made
each of these kinds of plants in only one place,
but from that they came to grow in many places.
Then he returned to Avikwame.</p>

Vannata is a root which is peeled and dried,

and tastes sweet. It grows in the valleys, while
the mescal grows in the mountains. The habitat
and name suggest Yucca, Walapai menat, but the
Walapai speak of cooking the fruit, not the root.</p>

<p><a name="ch07para17" id="ch07para17"></a>17. Planning for the Yavapai.&mdash;Now he said to
the people: "When I tell you: 'Be Walapai!' you
will be Walapai and will live in that country. When
I tell you: 'Be Chemehuevi!' and 'Be Mohave!' you
will be Chemehuevi and Mohave. But that is not yet.
First I want to make something for the Yavapai. So
I will go to their place next." He still had his
stick of sandbar willow with which he had made the
river. He said: "I do not want to put this away for
when I arrive there, I will thrust it down and make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
water: not much, but a little, enough for everyone
to drink. If they have no water at all, they
will not be able to live. So I will go and prepare
for them what they will eat and drink. I
will make a small country, enough only for a few.
In four days I will make the land for the Yavapai.
I will go to Ama&#7789;-ko-'omeome and to Ama&#7789;-kat&#353;ivekove
and plant seeds there."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para18" id="ch07para18"></a>18. Foods and water made for the Yavapai.&mdash;Now
in four days he went there. When he arrived,
he looked about: "It is not a good place to
plant; it is not level enough; too many mountains.
I will go to Avi-ke-hasalye." So he went
to Avi-ke-hasalye. He said: "This is where I
want people to live. It is a good place: there
is a long plain on each side." Again he took
gravel, put it in his mouth, and blew it out.
"I plant kalya'apa<a name="FNanchor_7_37" id="FNanchor_7_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> for the Yavapai: I give it
them for food. I give them also a good small
stream of water." Again he put gravel in his
mouth and blew it out over the valley eastward.
"This that I plant will be a'a,"<a name="FNanchor_7_38" id="FNanchor_7_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> he said. Then
he started and went to Ah'a-'ikiyareyare, thinking:
"I will go and make cottonwood trees (ah'a)
grow." When he came to Ah'a-'ikiyareyare, he
stood and pointed his stick to the west, to make
water flow from there. Then water came towards
him: it washed white sand. Taking a handful of
this sand in his mouth, he faced east and blew
out. Then kam'ipoi<a name="FNanchor_7_39" id="FNanchor_7_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> grew up. "That will be for
the Yavapai," he said; "they will eat the seeds."
Then he said: "I want this little water to be
here always. I do not want it ever to become
dry." Then, taking up sand, he blew it north:
akwava<a name="FNanchor_7_40" id="FNanchor_7_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> grew up in that direction. He thought:
"I will thrust my stick far down into the ground.
When I draw it up, a cottonwood will grow. That
is why I will call the place Ah'a-'ikiyareyare.
I will make only one cottonwood, but later there
will be many." He did this and thought: "Now I
have finished everything here: I will go back."
So he returned to Avikwame. He returned early in
the morning, after sunrise.</p>

Yavapai.&mdash;Then Mastamho said: "I have made something
for you Yavapai. I have finished it, but
I have still to tell you how to use it. If I do
not tell you, you will not know how to cook and
eat what I have made; after I tell you, you will
know and it will be well. But I will not tell you
yet." As he was speaking, they all listened: no
one said a word. He said again: "I have given you
all these things, but I have not finished. Now I
will show you how to speak. I want you to talk
like this," he said to the Chemehuevi. "I want
you to speak like this," he said, and gave their
language to the Walapai. "And I want you to speak
like this," he said to the Yavapai. But he gave
nothing to the Mohave as yet. Then he said: "Now
it is all made. I have prepared it. You can go,
you Walapai, and scatter in the mountains there.
You need not go into one place. You can go all
about, for I have made springs everywhere. You can
live in one spot, and when you want to live in
another you can do so. You Chemehuevi can do the
same, and you Yavapai too. But I will do differently
for the Mohave. They will have everything along the
river: whatever grows there will be theirs. It is
well."</p>


<h4>C. House, Shade, Sleep, and Playground: 20-35</h4>

<p><a name="ch07para20" id="ch07para20"></a>20. Planning a shade roof.&mdash;Now he was thinking
of building a shade, av'a-matkyalye.<a name="FNanchor_7_41" id="FNanchor_7_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> He said:
"I have spoken to the Mohave. Later on someone
will dream what I have told them, and will do accordingly.
To each of you, to all four tribes, I
have given something, and you will know it. I shall
not die like Matavilya, but will become a bird.
And there is something more that I will do for you,
you Mohave. It will be difficult for me and will
take a long time. I want someone to build a house.
This is no house where we are now. When I have had
a house made, I want you all to enter. Then I will
tell all of you what I shall be. This will be, not
soon, but in the future."</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_41" id="Footnote_7_41"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_7_41">[41]</a></span>
A brush roof on posts, ramada or arbor.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para21" id="ch07para21"></a>21. Ant makes dry ground.&mdash;Now the ground was
still wet at that time. Then Hanapuka, the small
ant, came up out of the ground, piling up little
heaps of dry sand; as Mastamho walked about, he saw
them. He said: "I wish it were all like this. I
wonder who it is that has made this come out of the
ground? I think I will call him Hanapuka." It was
the ant who had done it; it is he who made the
earth dry.</p>

<p><a name="ch07para22" id="ch07para22"></a>22. Two insects dig postholes.&mdash;He said again:
"Ant has made a dry place: now mark it out around.
I want the house to be built there. I want the Mohave
to enter it; and only they. You, Ama&#7789;-kapisara,
I want you to begin building it. I want you to dig
the holes to set the posts in. And you, Namit&#353;a,<a name="FNanchor_7_42" id="FNanchor_7_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
carry, and throw the sand farther away when he
digs." Now these two men dug holes and brought poles
for the house.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_42" id="Footnote_7_42"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_7_42">[42]</a></span>
Namit&#353;a is a large reddish insect, perhaps a
wasp, that throws earth as it burrows; or perhaps
the ant lion? Ama&#7789;-kapisara is evidently also a
burrowing insect: ama&#7789; is earth.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para23" id="ch07para23"></a>23. Shade built.&mdash;Then Mastamho said: "Wait!
Listen to me! I call the posts av'ulypo. Say that,
you Mohave! Say av'ulypo!" Then all said:
"Av'ulypo." When the posts were set and they were
ready to lay the girders across them Mastamho said:
"Call them iqumnau!" Then all said: "Iqumnau." Then
Mastamho said: "When you lay on the roof poles, call
them av'a-t&#353;utara! Now say that! Say av'a-t&#353;utara!"
and they all said: "Av'a-t&#353;utara." He said again:
"When you place the thatching of arrowweed on the
poles, call it av'a-t&#353;usive." Then they said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
"Av'a-t&#353;usive." He said again: "When you lay
willows or any other brush over the thatching,
call it av'anyut&#353;." So they said: "Av'anyut&#353;."
Then he said: "Now you have a shade. It will be
good for you. When the sun shines and it is hot,
you will go under the shade. That is what it is
for. Now that it is finished, I want all you
Mohave to come under it." Then the Mohave sat
under the shade. The Chemehuevi sat to the west
of it. On the east the Walapai sat to the north
and the Yavapai to the south. None of these
tribes said a word, and none of them entered
under the shade.</p>

<p><a name="ch07para24" id="ch07para24"></a>24. House planned.&mdash;Then Mastamho went to the
edge of the shade and stood leaning against the
post at the southeast corner. He said: "Now I
will build a house. I will make you understand:
you know nothing now. You do not know when a man
is hungry or thirsty or cold. You only know that
if he has no shade and stands in the sun, he becomes
hot. You know now that it is good under
the shade." Then he entered the shade again, went
to the northwest corner, and stood there. Then he
said: "Ama&#7789;-kapisara and Namit&#353;a, build another
house. Build av'a-hat&#353;ore. It will not be well to
sit under the shade always. When it is winter the
wind will come: perhaps it will rain and be cold.
But if you build a house, you can make a fire inside
of it when the rain and cold come. That is
why I will make a house for you Mohave. I will
build a house here at the back of the shade."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para25" id="ch07para25"></a>25. House built.&mdash;Again he told Ama&#7789;-kapisara
and Namit&#353;a to dig holes in the ground and to
bring posts. Then as he still stood, he said to
the people: "When you are about to build a house,
and you dig holes, call them ama&#7789;-ahuelkye." He
wanted them to learn that word. Then, as they
built, he told them to call the different parts
av'ulypo, iqumnau, av'a-t&#353;utara, av'a-t&#353;usive,
and av'anyut&#353; as before, and they repeated each
one. Then he said: "We have done all that. We
have covered it with brush. Now put sand on the
brush, so that the rain will not come through.
Call that av'a-ta'ive! Say: 'av'a-ta'ive!'" He
gave them that to say and they said it. He said
again: "When there is wind, build a house of timbers
and brush and sand. When you make a house
only of posts and thatch, call it av'a-t&#353;oamkuk.
But when you cover it with sand also, call it
av'a-tapuk."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para26" id="ch07para26"></a>26. Door made.&mdash;Then he said again: "Now that
the house is finished, I will tell you how to
make a door. You will see dead cottonwoods: strip
the bark from them,<a name="FNanchor_7_43" id="FNanchor_7_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> weave it together, and make
a mat longer than it is wide. Fasten it at the
upper corners to a stick. Then call it av'a-pete."</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_43" id="Footnote_7_43"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_7_43">[43]</a></span>
The inner bark is called hanu&#952;kwilye. "The
Mohave now use black willow bark, i&#948;o, but they
learned that themselves; Mastamho taught them to
employ ah'a, cottonwood."</p></div>

<p><a name="ch07para27" id="ch07para27"></a>27. Insect helpers given names.&mdash;Now the house
was complete, but he did not yet let the people
enter. He said: "I want you, Ama&#7789;-kapisara and
Namit&#353;a." He took them to the people and said: "I
will give these two men names for their work. When
they dug, they worked quickly. When they built the
house, they finished it quickly. So I will give
them names: listen well, so that you can all say
them. This man's name (Ama&#7789;-kapisara) is Ikinye-mast&#353;am-kwamit&#353;e.<a name="FNanchor_7_44" id="FNanchor_7_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Thus I give him a name, and
when you dream you will see him. Do not forget
what I tell you. In future some man will dream and
see him. No one will see me then, but they will
dream of me, and in that way they will know all
that I have said. They will have heard everything.
Now I have given this man a name. Now I will give
the other one a new name too. I call him Umas-amt&#353;e.<a name="FNanchor_7_45" id="FNanchor_7_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
People will dream and see him too."</p>

<div class="footnote">

Perhaps from amt&#353;ke, to travel, move about.
The insect is described as noisy and restless.

humar, child.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para28" id="ch07para28"></a>28. Sunset named.&mdash;Mastamho said: "The house
is finished; but I will not yet take you into it.
I said that I would give you food; I will not tell
you about it yet: nevertheless I will give it to
you. After you enter the house, I will tell you
what you will plant and what you will eat. When I
enter, I will tell you about what my body will be.
You know the sun, and sunset, and night. When the
sun goes down, we will enter the house. Now, when
it is nearly down, the time is anya-havek-t&#353;iemk.
Call it: anya-havek-t&#353;iemk!"</p>

<p><a name="ch07para29" id="ch07para29"></a>29. House entered.&mdash;When the sun went down, Mastamho
entered and said: "Come in, all of you." Then
all the Mohave entered the house. The Chemehuevi
stayed outside on the west. On the east were the
Walapai and Yavapai, the latter to the south. Mastamho
sat down, leaning back against the southwestern
one of the four middle posts. He was thinking
about the people inside and those outside. He said:
"There is a fire just within the door. Charcoal is
piled up there. That is what makes the house warm.
Now you understand: that is how it is done; you
have learned that." As he spoke he was leaning
against the post thinking. He put his hand behind
him.</p>

<p><a name="ch07para30" id="ch07para30"></a>30-32. Night; Future nights; Sleep.&mdash;30. He said:
"The mountains will always be here; but I cannot
live forever. Darkness is here forever and day is
here forever, but I cannot live like the sun and
like the mountains: I must die. I could tell you
about that, but I will not tell you tonight, because
you must sleep. You know now that it is night. You
know how to sleep. After you get up in the morning,
I will speak to you again and will tell you those
things. I will not tell everything as yet."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para31" id="ch07para31"></a>31. Now he no longer addressed them as Paut&#353;yet&#353;e-vukwi&#948;auve
as he had done at first; he called them
Pat&#353;umi-'it&#353;it&#353;-vukwi&#948;auve<a name="FNanchor_7_46" id="FNanchor_7_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> now. But he did not
tell them much. He spoke only a short time. He told
them two or three or four or five words and stopped.
He said: "This is not the only night: tomorrow will
be another. When one day is gone, another comes.
It will always be so. This is the first night:
there will be three more."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para33" id="ch07para33"></a>33. Day coming.&mdash;When it was nearly day, Mastamho
said: "Day is coming, but I will not yet
let you go outside: I want you to stay here for
four days and nights. Then on the fourth night,
toward morning, when it is still dark, I will
let you go to where you belong. It will not be
during the day, but in the night."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para34" id="ch07para34"></a>34. Playground made at Miakwa'orve.&mdash;When the
sun had risen, Mastamho went and stood outside
the house. He said: "I want to make a level
place." Then he leveled with his feet a place
that had been rough. He said: "Call it Miakwa'orve.<a name="FNanchor_7_52" id="FNanchor_7_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Can you say that? Say: 'Miakwa'orve!'"
Then all said: "Miakwa'orve." He told them:
"That is right. I will make a hill close to the
river below Miakwa'orve: swallows<a name="FNanchor_7_53" id="FNanchor_7_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> will live
there: I will call it Avi-kutaparve. Now say

<p><a name="ch07para35" id="ch07para35"></a>35. More in time.&mdash;Now he stayed at Avi-kutaparve
that day, preparing the place for the
swallows. At sunset he returned to Avikwame and
entered the house. He said: "I have made two
places: made them for you. When you come there,
to Miakwa'orve, those who are footracers will run.
Those who can sing will sing. Some will dance,
and some will gamble.<a name="FNanchor_7_54" id="FNanchor_7_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> But that is as much as I

<h4>D. Wild Seeds Planted: 36-42</h4>

<p><a name="ch07para36" id="ch07para36"></a>36. Planning to plant.&mdash;That night, in the
middle of the night, he said: "I am going down
to Av'a-&#952;emulye and Ama&#7789;-kusaye and Hat&#353;ioq-va&#7789;veve.<a name="FNanchor_7_55" id="FNanchor_7_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
There there are good places to plant
after the river has receded, and seeds will grow
there. Av'akwa&#952;pine,<a name="FNanchor_7_56" id="FNanchor_7_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> who came out when I first
made water in the north, and who has floated down
on the river, knows about that. I will have him
plant seeds for you Mohave; I will tell him to do
that for you. I think it will be a good place to
sow. In the morning I will go and have him plant
for you. When I return, I will tell you what he
has sowed. I will not tell you now, but in the
evening, after I come back." When he had finished
talking to them thus, he sat leaning forward with
bent head, thinking of what seeds he would plant.
He thought, but did not speak aloud. Then, in the
morning, he said to them: "Now I am ready to go.
I told you that today I would go to Av'a&#952;emulye
and Ama&#7789;-kusaye, and Hat&#353;ioq-va&#7789;veve. I told you
that when I had been there and had returned, I
would tell you what seeds had been sown. Now I am
going."</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_55" id="Footnote_7_55"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_7_55">[55]</a></span>
Two of these places are mentioned in Vinimulye-pat&#353;e,
<a href="#chap02">II</a>, <a href="#ch02para1">1</a>. They seem to be in Mohave Valley, on
the west side of the river, and Ama&#7789;-kusaye (or
-kusayi) is downstream from Hat&#353;ioq-va&#7789;veve.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_56" id="Footnote_7_56"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_7_56">[56]</a></span>
A duck, probably the scaup, mentioned before,
note <a href="#Footnote_7_16">16</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para37" id="ch07para37"></a>37. Scaup Duck plants four wild seeds in overflow.&mdash;Then
he went to Av'a-&#952;emulye and Ama&#7789;-kusaye
and Hat&#353;ioq-va&#7789;veve. When he came there, Av'akwa&#952;pine
was walking about in the mud like a boy at
play. He was entirely covered with mud. When Mastamho
saw him, he said: "I have been thinking
about you. I want you to plant four kinds of seeds:
akatai, aksamta, anki&#952;i, and aky&ecirc;se.<a name="FNanchor_7_57" id="FNanchor_7_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> It would be
hard if I were to give you all kinds of seeds to
plant: therefore I give you only these four. Now
plant those." Then Av'akwa&#952;pine took the seeds.
They were in four gourds, each kind in one gourd.
In the gourd to the southwest were akatai seeds.
Holding the gourd in his left hand, Av'akwa&#952;pine
took the seeds from it with his right hand, put
them into his mouth, and blew them out over the
mud. Then he took aksamta seeds from the northwest
gourd and blew them out to the northwest. The
anki&#952;i seeds he took from the gourd on the northeast
and blew them out in that way. Then he took
the aky&ecirc;se seeds from the southeast gourd and blew
them out to the southeast.<a name="FNanchor_7_58" id="FNanchor_7_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Now all four kinds
began to grow in the mud. He said: "See how fast
they grow. It will not be long." Then Mastamho
said: "That is good. I will go back and tell my
people about it."</p>

</div>

<p><a name="ch07para38" id="ch07para38"></a>38. You will understand later.&mdash;Then Mastamho
returned to tell his people about what Av'akwa&#952;pine
had done: "He has planted for you what will be your
food. You will know about it later, for as yet you
have no dishes, no pots, and no jars, and do not
know how to cook. I will tell you what to do to eat.
Now you think that it is merely necessary to take
with your hands what you want to eat: that is because
you do not yet know. But I will make you understand.
In time you will eat, and you will be
happy then. In time I will also tell you about my
turning into a bird. For I shall not die, but shall
live as a bird. Before that happens I will tell you
everything."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
<a name="ch07para39" id="ch07para39"></a>39. Planning for more planting.&mdash;Then Mastamho
said: "I have told you what Av'akwa&#952;pine has
planted for you. Now there is something else. In
the morning I will go downriver again, below
where I was. I will go to Avi-halykwa'ampa, Ama&#7789;-kaput&#353;ora,
Ama&#7789;-kaput&#353;or-ilyase, and Ama&#7789;-&#952;onohi&#948;auve.<a name="FNanchor_7_59" id="FNanchor_7_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
There I will get something else to
grow. Grass will grow there of itself, without
being planted by people. I will make Frog<a name="FNanchor_7_60" id="FNanchor_7_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> plant
it for you. He knows the water, for he lives in
it. I do not know him. When I made the river, I
saw various kinds of beings come out with it;
but I did not see him. He was born after the
river was flowing. And so he knows the places
where the grass will grow. Now it is three nights,
and tomorrow will be the fourth.<a name="FNanchor_7_61" id="FNanchor_7_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Then you all
will remain awake the whole night. You will not
sleep and I will tell you what I will do for you.
I will tell you that tomorrow. And this is all I
will say today. Now all sleep!"</p>

The number of nights is correct in contrast
with the same statement made by him two nights
later in par. <a href="#ch07para42">42</a>; see note <a href="#Footnote_7_62">62</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para40" id="ch07para40"></a>40. Frog told to be ready to plant.&mdash;Mastamho
remained awake all night. When it became daylight
outdoors, he looked about. Then he stood in the
door and said to his people: "Now I am going
down to Avi-halykwa'ampa, Ama&#7789;-kaput&#353;ora, Ama&#7789;-kaput&#353;or-ilyase,
and Ama&#7789;-&#952;onohi&#948;auve." Then he
went downriver until he came to Avi-halykwa'ampa.
There he stood on the mesa and looked. Near by,
below, was Ama&#7789;-&#952;onohi&#948;auve. He thought: "That
is a good place. It is level. I think it will be
a good place for growth whenever the river recedes."
Then he went there. He saw Frog sitting
there facing the north and making a noise. He
said to him: "I hear you making a noise. I know
what you mean: you want the river to flow toward
you. I know what you are saying: 'I want the water
to come here.'" Frog said: "Yes, that is
what I said." Mastamho told him: "After the water
has risen and when it has become dry once more,
I want you to plant something. That is why I came
here." Frog said: "Yes, I will plant it." Then
Mastamho went back to Avikwame. He said to his
people: "I saw Frog. I told him I wanted him to
plant; but I have not told him what to plant. I
am going back to him tomorrow. Then I will tell
him what seeds to plant."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para41" id="ch07para41"></a>41. Frog told what wild seeds to plant.&mdash;Next
morning he went to Ama&#7789;-&#952;onohi&#948;auve once more and
saw Frog again. He told him: "Now I will tell you
what to plant. I want you to plant akwava, kupo,
hamasqwere, ankike, kosqwake, and aksama: those
are the ones. Persons do not plant them: but you
will plant them, and when the water recedes they
will grow by themselves. No one knows about them:
only you know them, you who live in the water.
But all will see them after the high water has
gone down. Those plants grow by themselves without
having been sown, I will not tell you where to
make them grow, for you will know. Plant them
wherever you like. I want them to grow of themselves,
like cottonwoods and willows. So cause
them to spring up wherever you think best. I do
not even know how you will plant them. Perhaps
you will put seeds into your mouth and blow them
about; perhaps you will blow out water from your
mouth, or perhaps mud, and it will sprout and
grow. I do not know how you will do it, but I know
that you know how, and so you can do as you like."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para42" id="ch07para42"></a>42. Return to Avikwame.&mdash;When he returned to
Avikwame, Mastamho said: "Well, it is done. You
will all scatter along the river on both sides of
it. Everything has been arranged. I will not tell
you more now. I will not speak all night. Tonight
is three nights; tomorrow will be the fourth.<a name="FNanchor_7_62" id="FNanchor_7_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
Tomorrow I will not let you sleep: you will remain
awake and I will tell you what I shall become;
that I shall not die, but turn into a bird. That
is what I will tell you about on the fourth night,
but not today." Then they slept that night.</p>

<div class="footnote">

The narrator has lost his count: it is the
fifth night, not the third. See pars. <a href="#ch07para31">31</a>, <a href="#ch07para36">36</a>, <a href="#ch07para39">39</a>,

owing to other duties, I was able to work with
him only intermittently, and that it was now
several days since he had begun his narration to

<h4>E. Counting, Directions, Tribal Names: 43-58</h4>

<p><a name="ch07para43" id="ch07para43"></a>43. Preparation for the next night.&mdash;In the
morning Mastamho went outside. He wanted a place
to put the people outdoors. He said: "Tonight some
of you will become Mohave, some Chemehuevi, some
Walapai, some Yavapai, some Yuma, some Kamia;<a name="FNanchor_7_63" id="FNanchor_7_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
and some of you will become birds. I will tell you
about that tonight, but not during the day."</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_63" id="Footnote_7_63"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_7_63">[63]</a></span>
Another inconsistency, and expansion from
four to six, by the sudden inclusion of the Yuma
and Kamia. In pars. <a href="#ch07para9">9-19</a> and <a href="#ch07para23">23</a>, it is Chemehuevi,
Walapai, and Yavapai as set off from the Mohave.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para44" id="ch07para44"></a>44-46. First, second, third counts taught.&mdash;44.
When the sun set, all went into the house, and
Mastamho stood up. He said: "You are alive now. I
will tell you what you will eat. I will tell you
about corn and beans and melons and other food.
But first I will teach you how to count. I will
show you how to use your fingers. When you want
to say: 'Four days,' do like this." And he held up
four fingers. "When you want to tell of as many as
all these fingers, show them all. Now listen. All
be quiet and listen to me counting. Then perhaps
you will like it. If you do not like it, you can
listen to another way. Sint&#353;, t&#353;ekuvant&#353;, t&#353;ekamunt&#353;,
t&#353;ekapant&#353;, t&#353;eka&#952;ara, umota, kut&#353;yeta,
koat&#353;a, kwisan, noe.<a name="FNanchor_7_64" id="FNanchor_7_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Can you say that? How do
you like that counting?" Now those who were to be
Mohave did not say a word. They could not count
that way.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_64" id="Footnote_7_64"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_7_64">[64]</a></span>
The distortions of this and the two following
imperfect counts are analyzed in a separate
discussion following the myth.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
<a name="ch07para45" id="ch07para45"></a>45. So Mastamho said again: "Count like this:
sinye, mivanye, mimunye, mipanye, miranye, miyu&#353;,
mika&#353;, nyavahakum, nyavamokum, nyat&#353;upai, nyavali,
nyavalak. Can you say that? Do you like that
counting?" But they were silent. There were too
many words in that: more than ten.</p>

<p><a name="ch07para46" id="ch07para46"></a>46. So Mastamho counted for them again:
"Hatesa, hakiva, hakoma, t&#353;imkapa, &#952;apara, tinye,
sekive, kum, ayave, apare.<a name="FNanchor_7_65" id="FNanchor_7_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Now I have counted
ten. Perhaps you will like that." Again they did
not speak a word.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_65" id="Footnote_7_65"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_7_65">[65]</a></span>
This third try at a count interchanges the
consonants of the stressed syllable in the normal
Mohave words.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para47" id="ch07para47"></a>47. Final count taught.&mdash;Then he said: "Well,
I will make it four times: I will count once
more; that will be all. Then I will teach you
other things: for you do not yet know east and
west and north and south: I will teach you that.
Now I will count. Seto, havika, hamoka, t&#353;impapa,
&#952;arapa, sinta, vika, muka, paye, arrapa. Do you
like that? Can you say that?" Then they all said
it after him. They could count and liked it;
they knew how to do it and clapped their hands
and laughed.</p>

<p><a name="ch07para48" id="ch07para48"></a>48. Fingers made on hand.&mdash;Now their hands
were not yet as now: their fingers were still together.
Then Mastamho tore them apart and made
five fingers. "I want you to call this one isalye
t&#353;ikaveta.<a name="FNanchor_7_66" id="FNanchor_7_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Call
this one isalye itma-kanamk.<a name="FNanchor_7_67" id="FNanchor_7_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>

Middle, fourth, and little fingers, of course.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para49" id="ch07para49"></a>49. First direction names taught.&mdash;He said
again: "Now we are here in this house: all will
know and hear it. Now when I mean here," and he
pointed his hand to the north, "all say: 'Amai-hayame.'"
But they did not do so: they kept
their hands against their bodies; they wanted
another name; they did not like that word. Then
he said: "And there is Amai-hakyeme; all say
that!" And he pointed south. But again all sat
still: they did not want to call it that. He
said again: "Well, there is another: there is
the way the night goes.<a name="FNanchor_7_69" id="FNanchor_7_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> I do not know where
its end is, but when we follow the darkness that
is called Amai-hayime." He said that, but none
of the Mohave said a word: they sat with their
hands against the body. Then Mastamho said once
more: "You see the dark coming. I do not know
where it comes from: I did not make it. But
where darkness comes from, I call that Amai-hayike."
Again they sat still and did not point.<a name="FNanchor_7_70" id="FNanchor_7_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

The Mohave, like the far-away Yurok, constantly
speak of night coming from the east and
traveling west.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_70" id="Footnote_7_70"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_7_70">[70]</a></span>
The plan underlying the twisting of the
terms of direction is less clear than for the
other series of words. See discussion at end.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para50" id="ch07para50"></a>50. Final direction names taught.&mdash;Then Mastamho
said once more: "I have named all the directions
but you have not answered. Well, there are
other names. Listen: I call this (the north) Mathak.
Can you say that?" Then all said, "Yes," and
stood up, and pointed north, and said, "Mathak."
He said again: "This (to the south) I call Kaveik.
Can you say it?" Then all said, "Yes," and pointed
and called the name and clapped their hands and
laughed. He said again: "I told you that the night
went in that direction. I gave it a name, but you
did not say it. There is another way to call it:
Inyohavek. All of you say that!" Then they all
said: "Yes, we can say that. We can call it Inyohavek,"
and all pointed as he directed them. He
said again: "Where the dark comes from, you did
not call that as I told you to. There is another
way to call it: Anyak." Then all said: "Anyak,"
and pointed east and clapped their hands and
laughed. Then Mastamho said: "That is all."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para51" id="ch07para51"></a>51. Mispronounced tribal names.&mdash;Mastamho said:
"Some of you are outside, east of the house: I
want you to be the Hamapaivek. Some of you are
outdoors west of the house: I call you Hamivevek.
You people in the house, just west of the door, I
call you Hamit&#353;anvek. You just inside the door,
near these last, I call Hamiaivek. You people near
the fire here, not against the wall, I call you
Hamahavek." He called them by these names, but
all the people did not answer. They did not say:
"Yes, we will be called that." All of them said
nothing.<a name="FNanchor_7_71" id="FNanchor_7_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

These distorted forms consist of prefix
Ham-, a suffix -vek, and the accented syllable
(plus preceding unaccented vowel) of the correct
Mohave name for the tribe. See discussion at end.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para52" id="ch07para52"></a>52. Walapai and Yavapai tribes named.&mdash;Then
Mastamho said again: "This time I will call you
who are on the east Havalyipai."<a name="FNanchor_7_72" id="FNanchor_7_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Then those people
called that name easily, and all those indoors
said: "Now they are the Walapai." Then he said
again: "Those will be the Yavapai also. I want
them (the Walapai and the Yavapai) to live near
each other in the mountains." Those are the ones
that at first he had called Hamapaivek.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="ch07para53" id="ch07para53"></a>53. Chemehuevi named.&mdash;Then he said again:
"Those outdoors on the west, whom at first I called
Hamivevek, I now call T&#353;imuveve. All say that!"
Then all said: "Chemehuevi."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para54" id="ch07para54"></a>54. Yuma and Kamia named.&mdash;He said again: "Those
just inside the door on the west of it I called
Hamit&#353;anvek. Now I call you Kwit&#353;(i)ana (Yuma)."
He said again: "You near them, whom at first I
called Hamiaivek, I now call Kamia. You two will
live near each other."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para55" id="ch07para55"></a>55. Mohave named.&mdash;Then he said: "I have made
you all to be tribes, Walapai, Yavapai, Chemehuevi,
Yuma, and Kamia: you are all different. I also
spoke the name Hamahavek. Now I call them Hamakhave.
All will call you that, you Mohave, and will
know you by that name."</p>

<a name="ch07para56" id="ch07para56"></a>56. Told to stay a while.&mdash;He said: "I have
told you where I want you each to go. You know
the places and you know the way. I will not take
you there: you can go by yourselves. But it is
too dark yet: you may go in the morning." They
had been ready to go, and had stood up, even
though it was still night. He told them: "It is
too early now. If you go during the night, you
will become confused. Listen to me, and do not
mix with one another: stay here." Then he drew
lines with his foot for the three tribes inside
the house, and told them to remain within the
marks. He went outside and drew marks for the
Chemehuevi, telling them: "Stay here," and the
same for the Walapai and Yavapai on the west. As
he said to each, "Stay here," he waved (flapped)
his hands downward from his extended arms.</p>

<p><a name="ch07para57" id="ch07para57"></a>57. Doctors will dream of this.&mdash;Mastamho said
again: "Follow me, and do the same. Listen! In
future some men will dream: they will be doctors.
If you dream of me at night, you will be crazy.
Some men will be doctors who can cure sickness
by touching with their hands. They will not tell
of me, but only sing about me. If you wait here,
you will hear of this and know about me."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para58" id="ch07para58"></a>58. Takes new name.&mdash;He walked about. He
stood at the north end of the house. He said:
"My name is Pahut&#353;at&#353;-yamasam-kwakirve. That is
my name now. First my name was Mastamho. But I
have left that, and now it is Pahut&#353;at&#353;-yamasam-kwakirve.
Whoever dreams about me will know me
by that name."</p>


<h4>F. Hawks and War: 59-69</h4>

<p><a name="ch07para59" id="ch07para59"></a>59-62. Four hawks given names and war power.&mdash;59.
Now in the middle of the house four men were
sitting leaning against the posts. Mastamho said
to them: "You will be birds. You," he said to
one, "your name is Soqwilye-akataya.<a name="FNanchor_7_73" id="FNanchor_7_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Stand up!

<p><a name="ch07para60" id="ch07para60"></a>60. Then he called another one of the same
name<a name="FNanchor_7_77" id="FNanchor_7_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and said to him: "I want you to make dust

The name is the same except for the "infixes" -nu- and -ke-.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para61" id="ch07para61"></a>61. He called out the third one,<a name="FNanchor_7_79" id="FNanchor_7_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and gave
him the name Ampo&#7789;-em-kut&#353;u-var-ve.<a name="FNanchor_7_80" id="FNanchor_7_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

He told them all how to fight: "If there
are four or five men on the other side of where
you have made it dusty and dark, you can dash
across to the enemy. If people dream of you, they
will kill enemies in battle; but if they dream that
they are in the dark and cannot see, they will not
be able to kill in battle."</p>

kunulyke, var, min); and the suffix -ve or -va.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para63" id="ch07para63"></a>63. Practice trial.&mdash;Now a man was standing
outdoors, north of the house: his name was Ampo&#7789;-kwasanye.
Mastamho said: "Let us see who of you
will be lucky, who will kill men." Then Ampo&#7789;-em-kut&#353;u-kunuly-ke-va
rushed through the darkness and
caught this man. Thus he learned how to do, and
all shouted and laughed. Mastamho said: "Now you
four know how. You will be the ones to do that."</p>

<p><a name="ch07para64" id="ch07para64"></a>64. Weapons to be made.&mdash;"Now I will tell you
what to make in order to fight with. Make the bow

Make the knobbed war club<a name="FNanchor_7_83" id="FNanchor_7_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> from (bean-)

When I say anything, he does not look at me: he
looks away. If he had looked at me when I spoke,
he would have been an important man. But since
he turned away and did not listen, he will not
be a chief. He does not talk loudly, and no one
listens to what he says. Some will dream of him:
they will be great men among the people, but
they will not live long. This man too will be a

He also will not be important. If you

you are. Before you change, I want you to say
everything that I have told you. When there is
war, put kat&#353;etulkwa-'anya-ye on your shoulder.
It is bright: that is how you will be able to

Gnatcatcher will take the land where the mesquite

<h4>J. Mastamho's Transformation into

<p><a name="ch07para82" id="ch07para82"></a>82. Turns into Bald Eagle at Avi-kutaparve.&mdash;Mastamho
was standing at Avi-kutaparve. Now he
proceeded to leave (change) his body. That is
why the little mountain there is now white in
one place. Mastamho was looking to the north,
standing close by the river. He wanted to have
wings and flap them. He moved his arms four times
to make them into wings. Then he said: "See, I
shall be a bird. Not everyone will know me when
I am a bird. My name will be Saksak."<a name="FNanchor_7_123" id="FNanchor_7_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

the fish-diving osprey.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para83" id="ch07para83"></a>83. Floats downriver to Hokusave.&mdash;Then he
turned around twice from right to left, facing
south, and then north, then south and north again,
and lay down on his back in the middle of the
river. Four times he moved his arms in the water.
Thus he reached Hokusave.<a name="FNanchor_7_124" id="FNanchor_7_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Then he had wings
and feathers, and rose from the water. He flew
low above the water so that his wings touched it.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="ch07para84" id="ch07para84"></a>84. Flies south to sea, is crazy (unknowing).&mdash;He
flew southward, looking for a place to sit. He
settled on a sandbar. But he thought: "It is not
good: I will not sit here"; and he went on again.
He sat on a log, but thought again: "No, I do not
like this," and went on. He sat on a bank, but
thought: "No, it is not good," and went on. So
he went far down to the sea where the river emptied
into it. There he stayed, and lived near the
river eating fish. Now he was crazy and full of
lice and nits.<a name="FNanchor_7_125" id="FNanchor_7_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Now when he had told everything
and was a bird, he forgot all that he had known.
He did not even know any longer how to catch
fish. Sometimes other birds kill fish and leave
part of them. Then Saksak eats them, not knowing
any better. He is alone, not with other birds,
and sits looking down at the water: he is crazy.</p>

eagle is killed it is said to be always lousy
and to smell of fish. People who dream of Mastamho
after he became the bald eagle know nothing
and are crazy (yamomk) like him.</p>

took his place. So wanting to make a field for
play, mat&#257;re, they drew their feet in a line over
the ground for the people to stand on facing north.
"No, it will not do;" they said. Then they drew
lines for them to stand on facing east, and south,

so the people could look toward the west.<a name="FNanchor_7_127" id="FNanchor_7_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Then

take this good-looking woman's hand. If she takes
yours, it will be because she likes you; but if she

There is little on record about the Yaroyare
song-cycle. The narrator, on another occasion,
coupled Yaroyare and Ipa-m-im&#299;t&#353;e
(person-wail) as dealing with Matavilya's sickness
and death at Ha'avulypo, of the dreamers
laying their hand on him, and the like. They
sing and tell about this at people's death, he
said. He knew one man who had dreamed this: his
name was Kolhonye&#353;u&#948;uk (alive in 1903), who was
a doctor, but only for ahwe'-ahnok, "foreign
sickness" due to eating alien tribes' food.&mdash;Another
informant, At&#353;y&ocirc;ra-hunyava, did not mention
Yaroyare but coupled Ipa-m-im&#299;t&#353;e with
Humahn&#257;n, a cycle named after a black, hard,
stinking beetle. Both singings use no rattle or
other instrument and belong to doctors who cure
sickness due to eating hawk-wounded birds, or
birds killed by oneself, or to birds which cause
young babies to be sick with white stools.&mdash;All
this does not sound like having much to do with
courtship and play.</p></div>

Quail<a name="FNanchor_7_136" id="FNanchor_7_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> came from those places.
He was a good-looking man, with fine eyes, and
hair tied at the ends below his hips. Now as he
approached the woman and tried to seize her hand,
she, knowing that where he came from was where
they gave power, was dissatisfied with him and
folded her arms, so as to cover her hands. So
Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e and Hat&#353;inye-kunuya said:
"This is not the place to acquire power and
learn to be a doctor: we are teaching other
things: we are showing how to sing and dance.
This is no place for a doctor to come to." Then
Quail went back, and stood at a distance, and
all the people laughed and clapped their hands.
Now these two men, Sparrowhawk and Quail, were
good looking, but it was with them as it is with
some men now, who are good looking but fail to
marry women they want. As Quail came from where

Mastamho had turned into a bird and gone south,
one other man went also. His name was Ampo&#7789;-yama&#952;am-kuvevare.
He, too, reached the sea. Now he said: "I
thought that everything had been made and that all
had turned into birds: but it is not finished yet.
I hear a noise at Miakwa'orve: I will go there."
Then he started to return. He came to Aksam-kusaveve,
and from there he went on to Hanemo'-ara, where
there is a lake.<a name="FNanchor_7_144" id="FNanchor_7_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> When he looked into the water
there, he saw little fish, at&#353;i-mikulye, and caught
four. He put leaves of black willow through the
gills of the four fish, and so made a head dress
like the feathers worn on a stick at the back of
the head: he called it at&#353;i-sukulyk. From there he
went on to Miakwa'orve. He did not go among the
rows of people, but stood at the side and looked
at the woman. He had whitened his face with dust
which he had rubbed on his hands on the ground.
Now he stretched out his arm toward the woman. She
put out her hand, and he took it and pulled her
over to where he stood. Then they said: "That man
has her: he is married to her." And all laughed.
He was Great Blue Heron.<a name="FNanchor_7_145" id="FNanchor_7_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> He is not a handsome
bird now and was not a handsome man then, but he

and if they leave these, they readily secure others.
And so now all the people said: "He has taken
Pahut&#353;at&#353;-yamasam-iarme: she is his wife: her husband
is Heron." Now Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e and

there was a girl called Hat&#353;inye-kwora'e. When
all went away from Ha'avulypo at night, after the
house there had been burned, she came back next
morning alone, looking for food that might have
been thrown away. From there she did not go with
the others to Avikwame and Miakwa'orve, but traveled
westward<a name="FNanchor_7_146" id="FNanchor_7_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> until
she came to Otahvek-hunuve.<a name="FNanchor_7_147" id="FNanchor_7_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
There she made with her hands a round level place
on top of the mountain. Now, as she stood there
facing north, she heard the noise from Miakwa'orve.
Then she started for it. When she came to Oyat&#353;-ukyulve
and Hokusave, she stood still and heard
the noise from Miakwa'orve more loudly and saw the
dust rising. So she went on and reached Miakwa'orve.
Then Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e and Hat&#353;inye-kunuya said
to her: "We have made every thing: it is finished,
and the people here have the knowledge. But we will
tell you the same that we told them. You are a

started to go to those two places. When they arrived,
Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e and Hat&#353;inye-kunuya
made a large circle on the ground. Then, standing
to the west of it, they said: "Let us see you
all run with your mouths shut tight, holding your
breath. Do not breathe until you have gone around
the ring. If you breathe only then, you will be
footracers." Then they pierced the septum of the
nose of those who were about to run, for four at
a time; when four had been pierced, they ran.
Then Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e and Hat&#353;inye-kunuya
would pierce another four, and these ran. Now
some of them could not run all the way. Some went
part way and breathed out, "Wh!" and everybody
laughed because such as these could not run well.
Then Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e and Hat&#353;inye-kunuya
pierced the noses of four and with them of Kasunyo-kurrauve,<a name="FNanchor_7_151" id="FNanchor_7_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
so that five of them ran together.
The other four became exhausted after one circuit,
but Kasunyo-kurrauve ran around four times with
his mouth still shut. Only after the fourth circuit,
he said: "Wh!" Then Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e
and Hat&#353;inye-kunuya said to him: "You are the one
who can run. Those who will dream of you will be

noses pierced, and Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e and
Hat&#353;inye-kunuya said to them: "Now we will throw
you into the water." But there was one left inside
the ring, who sat crying because no hole had
been made in his nose. He wanted his nose pierced
too, but it could not be done, for it was too
flat to perforate; therefore he cried. He said:
"If you do not pierce me, I shall not be able to
go with the others but must stay here." So he
sat crying with his hands together, and all stood
there about him. Some said: "Well, why can we not
pierce his nose?" But others said: "It cannot be
done. It is too flat, like my hand." "Well, let
us try it anyway," they said. Then Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e
and Hat&#353;inye-kunuya went to him and, by
drawing out his nose, succeeded in piercing it.
Then he was glad. He is Yahalyetaka.</p>

them had not yet turned into birds. Then Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e
said: "We will go back to Miakwa'orve:
we want to do something more." Then he started with
Hat&#353;inye-kunuya and with those that were still people.
When they came to Avi-kutaparve, they stood
there. Then Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e and Hat&#353;inye-kunuya
said: "We have done what he wanted us to do:
we have made them birds. We have made it that those
who will live in this country in the water and near
the river will be here. And they know how to marry:
they will have children and so they will continue.
You know how: you saw Ampo&#7789;-yama&#952;am-kuvevare become
married. Those who will live here have learned from
that. But some will marry a woman and feel well,
but later they will become sick. We will tell about
that also. There will be men who dream about that,
and such men will know how to cure venereal disease.
We will not tell you that here, but we will go where
the darkness goes, and when we come to another place
like Miakwa'orve, we will tell you there. Rattlesnake's
Playground<a name="FNanchor_7_160" id="FNanchor_7_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> is that place. We will make
you birds there, mountain birds, who will not be
about here. And there will be some who will dream
about us at that place."</p>

Hayekwire-nye-mat&#257;re, a dry lake bed which
the railroad crosses between Mojave station and

of Mojave, wide, level, entirely without vegetation,
and surrounded by mountains.</p>

<p><a name="ch07para99" id="ch07para99"></a>99. Thrasher and Mockingbird at Rattlesnake's
Playground teach veneral cure.&mdash;Then they started;
and near sunset they arrived at Rattlesnake's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
Playground. Then Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e and Hat&#353;inye-kunuya
said: "When you have intercourse, you will
think you feel good. But some of you will be sick
from that. Some women will have a baby. When it is
born, it will cause them great pain in the belly.
The pain will go back into them and will be a sickness
in the bones." Then they hooked their middle
fingers into the middle fingers of the people who
were still with them and swung them to the left.
This they did to all of them, saying: "You will
understand." After they had been swung, all sat
looking at the ground, and appeared thin and sickly.
Then the two talked to them again, and sang four
songs. When they had sung the four songs, the flesh
had returned to them and they were healthy once
more; and they all shouted and laughed.</p>

<p><a name="ch07para100" id="ch07para100"></a>100. More songs for this.&mdash;The two said to them:
"You have seen us do that: you all know it now.
When someone dreams about us, let him tell what we
have said. When they cure sickness, let them say
what we have said, and the sick person will get well.
Sometimes a man will like a woman. She will sleep
with him and soon he will be sick. Or she will like
him, and kiss him, their saliva will come on each
other, they will become sick, and have pains in the
body. Then sing about us and you will cure them."
Then they sang again for them.<a name="FNanchor_7_161" id="FNanchor_7_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

Making the total number of songs used by the
doctors of such sickness much greater than the four
first mentioned. In addition, the narrator stated,
Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e and Hat&#353;inye-kunuya sang
other songs, later learned by other people, to cure
different kinds of sickness; but of that he himself
did not dream.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="ch07para101" id="ch07para101"></a>101. At Three Mountains, Thrasher, Mockingbird,
and rest turn to mountain birds.&mdash;Now in the morning
Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e and Hat&#353;inye-kunuya
wanted them to try to fly; they wished them to
learn flying. Four times they all rose into the air
and settled again, Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e and Hat&#353;inye-kunuya
with the others. Then they flew off, northward
to Three Mountains.<a name="FNanchor_7_162" id="FNanchor_7_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> When they arrived there, they
were birds, and no longer knew where they came from.
Then Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e and Hat&#353;inye-kunuya said:
"Now we know nothing. Now we think no more, for we
are birds. We are Thrasher and Mockingbird. When you
dream of us, and tell of us and of Three Mountains,
for a person that is sick, you will cure him. Say:
'I saw them do that: I heard them say that.' Then the
person will become well. Tell them that we said so
and so."</p>

<h4>N. Leftover Straggler Reaches the Sea: 102</h4>

<p><a name="ch07para102" id="ch07para102"></a>102. Hakutatkole, left for Po&#353;oik sickness, goes
south to sea and becomes a bird.&mdash;Now when the others
had all flown off to Three Mountains, one of them,
Hakutatkole, nevertheless had stayed at Rattlesnake's
Playground. He was sick with po&#353;oik<a name="FNanchor_7_163" id="FNanchor_7_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> in his mouth.
Ikinye-istum-kwamit&#353;e and Hat&#353;inye-kunuya had said:
"We do not want that kind of man with us," and had
left him. So he went south, alone, until he reached
Halyuilyve. Now at Konyokuvilyo and Ha'tana there
was another man, Himeikwe-halyepoma, who also taught,
but about other things. Hakutatkole, coming to where
he lived, approached him with his hand over his
mouth; but Himeikwe-halyepoma, coming to meet him,
pulled away his hand from his mouth, and said: "Do
not come here!" and pushed him away. So Hakutatkole
went south to the sea,<a name="FNanchor_7_164" id="FNanchor_7_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and there he, too, became
a bird.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_163" id="Footnote_7_163"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_7_163">[163]</a></span>
A minor skin disease, for which the Mohave
do not employ doctors. They fear it as contagious,
however, and others do not use the clothing or
food dishes of the person afflicted. Hakutatkole
is said to have received this sickness from swallowing
sea fog: the bird is spotted inside the mouth.</p>

The trial names for tribes, paragraph <a href="#ch07para51">51</a>, are
built around the accented syllable of the normal
Mohave form of the name. To this is prefixed <i>ham</i>-,
followed by the vowel -<i>a</i>- or -<i>i</i>-. This prefix may
possibly be taken from the Mohaves' name for themselves,
Hamakhava or Hamakhave. There is also a
suffix -<i>vek</i>; which may or may not be suggested
by the final syllable of Hamakhave and T&#353;imuveve.
These devices yield a list that jingles with initial
and final rhymes: but the parts seem unetymological.</p>

<p>The concocted names of objects having to do
with preparation of food seem not to be made by
jingles or twistings, but to be descriptive ritualistic
circumlocutions somewhat like the long
compound names of myth personages. I cannot translate
most of them; but there are a few indications.
The large t&#353;uvave cook pot is called umas-te-hamoka
because it rests on three (hamoka) supports
in the fire. Katela, a double-pointed parching
bowl, is spoken of as umas-eyavkwa-havik, the
last element meaning two. The frequent prefix
umas- occurs in the names of many myth personages;
it seems to be a form of humar, child; why
it is used here is obscure. Umas-ekyire seems to
be a distortion of karri'i, the usual word for
basket. T&#353;amat&#353;-ke-hut&#353;at&#353; for t&#353;amat&#353;, food, suggests
Pa-hut&#353;at&#353;, another name for Mastamho, as
in paragraphs <a href="#ch07para73">73-75</a>; also his name in the Goose
myth (Handbook, p. 767). The name may mean "food
person."</p>

girls are obtained successively from W, E (as wives for the younger
brother), N, S (for the older). The cages of the girls' birds are
twisted, successively, of red and white, red and blue, (unstated),
and red and blue cloth. In Mastamho, paragraphs <a href="#ch07para49">49-50</a>, the direction
names are taught in the order: N, S, W, E.</p>

<p>It is evident that the Mohave like the formalism of four times,
of cardinal directions, and often of a circuit; but that, especially
as compared with Hopi, Zuni, and Navaho, they are untrammeled as to
turn, start, end, color, or other associations. This is evidently
because they wholly lack strict rituals such as these other southwestern
tribes have developed so abundantly with manipulations, altars,
cult objects, schematized songs, fetishes, and priests.</p>
